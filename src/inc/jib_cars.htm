<p>We have replaced our old aluminum jib cars, which had developed cracks around the pivot, with a simple dyneema loop around a <a href='https://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f116/dyneema-loops-blocks-as-an-alternative-to-a-jib-car-146801.html' target='_blank'>frictionless sailing ring</a>. Dyneema is a ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene(UHMWPE) which has many uses, and it is now commonly used to rig sailboats(or as {lifelines}). It is lightweight, and strong as hell.</p>

<p>When came time to replace our jib cars we did not have a ton of options, we can't machine parts ourselves because we don't have access to a workshop. Approaching metal workers was a no-go either, they were too busy with higher paying contracts to take on something so small (it's not as worth it for them). We tried sourcing other ready-built jib car designs, like the twin sheet lead blocks by Schaefer Marine, but no local marine store had any the models we wanted in stock because of covid-related supply chain issues. We were hesitant to buy those jib cars anyway because of the associated price tag of $300USD(per jib car...!).</p>

<p>We gave up on sourcing ready-built designs, and got some frictioness sailing rings(sized to our jib sheets), a length of dyneema, and two 3.17cm (1 1/4") T-track spring-stop lined eye slides by Schaefer Marine. The slides are stainless steel but lined with nylon inserts so there's no metal to metal contact.</p>

<h3>Braid</h3>

<p>We followed <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-4AYV7jKRA' target='_blank'>this tutorial</a> on how to braid the loop of dyneema to make a end-to-end MÃ¶bius Brummell Splice. We made a fid(a hollow spike for use in ropework) from an old knitting needle. We have secured the loop around the sailing ring and on itself, with a few stitches of waxed thread.</p>

<p>Looking to splice other types of ropes? See some splicing tutorials from <a href='http://nautilusbraids.co.nz/brummel-splicing/' target='_blank'>Nautilus Braids</a>.</p>

<p>We have used these jib cars for a few summers now, and they are doing very well! In the off season, we take the jib cars off off the track and keep them indoors (to prolong their life).</p>

<p>We broke the tip of our plastic fid recently, while trying to redo a splice for our chain to rope anchor rode. Perhaps it's time to seek out a sturdier design.</p>
