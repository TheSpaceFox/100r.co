<p>We carry 3 anchors onboard. We have a Bruce 10 kg (22 lbs), and a Rocna 10 kg (22 lbs) and 15 kg (33 lbs). We carry 30.5 m (100 ft) of chain, with 61 m (200 ft) of 3-strand nylon.</p>

<p>We anchor using a {snubber} to lighten the load on our chain stopper. Our boat doesn't have a windlass, we haul the anchor up by hand. The chain stopper helps catch the chain so it is easier to hoist back up.</p>
