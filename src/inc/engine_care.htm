<p>We have learned a lot about diesel engines over the years, we combined these learnings into 3 categories:</p>

<p><b>Service inspection checklist</b>. What parts need to be serviced on a diesel engine.<br>
<b>Service items</b>. What to change/check daily, monthly and annually.<br>
<b>Spares list</b>. What spares to carry. The amount of spares depends on the duration of the trip. A long-distance cruiser will require more spares.<br>
<b>General notes</b>. A collection of notes on engine-related parts, like on oil, coolant, belts, coolant pump, salt water pump, mufflers, belts, zincs, ventilation etc.<br>
<b>Troubleshooting</b>. Common problems, their causes, and how to solve them.</p>

<p><b>Oil notes</b>: It is best to change the oil in the winter, not in the spring so that the engine can sit in clean oil. After using the engine, the oil takes on a black color, a byproduct of combustion. Modern types of oil prevent sediment formation in the oil pan, so there is no need to clean it. When changing the oil, always change the oil filter (insert trick not to make a mess). When adding a new filter, coat the o-ring with oil and tighten by hand (a 3/4 turn is enough). Check the engine after replacing the filter to see if there is a leak. Overtightening the filter can make it very difficult to remove.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of oil, each with their own viscosity (SAE class, flow properties as a function of the operating temperature) and API (American petroleum institute) rating. Diesel engine formulated oil will have additives not required in gasoline engines. Diesel engines need a C rating (CC being the minimum). Older engines don't need high performance oil (CF is the oldest type). If a bottle of oil has the text 'energy conserving' it means that its viscosity allows for reduced fuel consumption (less fuel burnt to turn components inside engine), it also reduces friction. Using synthetic oils is fine, because it is less viscous it is fantastic in cold climates. Synthetics allow allow for longer service intervals. As a general rule, don't mix oils of different types (viscosities). In the Pacific Northwest, 15W40 is the norm. Engine oils of class 15W40 are multigrade oils. </p>

<p><b>Coolant notes</b>: Important to test the antifreeze once in a while to check the level of glycol to prevent freezing and to check the PH of the coolant. As it ages, coolant turns too acidic and can corrode the unit. It is possible to buy pre-mixed coolant (more volume) or a concentrate (less volume, but you need to add 50% water). There is long life coolant, and regular coolant, never mix the two kinds. They come in a variety of colors, differing from diesel, or oil so that it is easy to identify a leak.</p>
<p>The heat exchanger water pump is metal and integral to the unit, it cannot be serviced. If for whatever reason it fails, it must be replaced entirely. The coolant water pump has a drain hole, if the seal of the pump breaks it may leak. Lifting paint or discoloration near the joint is indicative of such a leak.</p>

<p><b>Belts notes</b>: Belts stretch overtime, and must be checked. An alternator is a load on a belt, if it is too tight it becomes a strain on both the alternator and the water pump. An engine that is overheating can damage a belt. If the belt starts to create dust on your engine it is because it is too tight, too thin or because the alternator is too big (too demanding for the engine size).</p>

<p><b>Salt water pump</b>: Service once per year. Take out the impeller to look at it. If the engine runs dry for too long (no water, due to closed thru-hull or blockage), it can damage the impeller. Removing the impeller with an <b>impeller puller</b> is ideal (especially for large impellers), but otherwise it's possible to remove using two screwdrivers as leverage, if using this method be careful not to damage the water pump housing. When checking an impeller, check that the nubs are nice and round, and that all the arms are straight. When inside the housing, the arms have a curve but should spring back when the impeller is taken out. It is important for the arms to be straight so that they follow the inside walls of the housing perfectly, if they do not touch the walls there will be no vacuum and the pump won't pull water through. If an engine is allowed to sit for too long, the arms can set in the wrong position, if that happens the impeller should be replaced.<br>Check the impeller of cracks between the arms, a severely damaged impeller will have arms missing. If it is missing arms, it will be necessary to check the engine for the lost bits (they can clog the system). The arms usually find their way to the heat exchanger. The impeller doesn't need to go back in any specific way, adding dishsoap to help slide it back in helps. Dish soap is also useful if the impeller is hard to remove. If replacing the impeller, replace the gasket too (spare impellers usually come with it). If there is no spare gasket, it is possible to make out of thin paper, or to use liquid gasket. The pump will have drain holes in case the seal fails.</p>

<p><b>Heat exchanger pump notes</b>: Salt water runs through the heat exchanger to cool the coolant. There may be accumulations of salt at the mouth (or forgotten impeller bits), which ought to be cleared. If flow is restricted, the motor will be running hot. It is a good ideal to periodically change the seal, the seal helps keep the coolant and salt water separate. If the coil inside of the heat exchange is sludgy, it is because the coolant has stayed in too long.</p>

<p><b>Muffler</b>: A muffler quiets the exhaust, and acts as a water lock. It is at its fullest when the engine is not running. Mufflers have drains, they can corrode and must be checked periodically. A muffler can be made of plastic, or metal.</p>

<p><b>Hoses</b>: The hose from the engine to the muffler ought to be as straight as possible, and at a slant (high from engine to low at muffler) to prevent the pooling of water. If the engine has been overheating, check this hose for damage. Hoses used with engines have many layers, and when there is excessive heat theses layers can begin to part and retain water. For engine use hard wire hoses are best. Tie hoses down to avoid chafe. Check ends of hoses often, they fail often.<br>Use quality clamps, like <b>AWAB</b> or <b>T-bolt</b> clamps, designs that are smooth, that don't have sharp inner bits that can cut into a hose. When applying a clamp over a hose to secure it to a part of the engine, make note where the hose intake/outake ends so that you don't run the risk of compressing the hose itself, restricting flow and damaging the hose. If there is no room to put two clamps (the nipple isn't long enough), put one.</p>

<p><b>Zinc</b>: Check zincs often, replace before completely worn. Heat exchange uses pencil zincs. They have a standard length, but not all heat exchange zinc housings can accomodate it. Before placing it, insert a pencil in the hole to see how deep the hole goes, and trim the zinc if necessary. Not cutting the zinc can result in breakage, and leaks. When screwing in new pencil zinc, add liquid seal at the head of the pencil zinc to prevent leakages.</p>

<p><b>Ventilation</b>: 60°C (140°F) is the max heat an engine room ought to have. Ventilation is more important for bigger engines. Small engines may have passive ventilation, with the air intake sucking up air from the engine room itself and with the outtake coming out of an aft dorade. The forward motion of a boat is usually enough to move the heat, but otherwise a small fan fitted to the outtake duct is useful. Air ducts are sized to the engine power, make sure nothing is crushing the duct. Check periodically for delamination of the duct.</p>

<p><b>Fuel</b>: For a fuel system to run fine, the fuel needs to be clean before it reaches the injectors. It is the job of the primary, and secondary fuel filter (on engine) to clean the fuel. Dirty fuel (water and dirt) at the injectors can damage them, because each part of an injector is tight-fitting with no play.  </p>

<p><b>Fuel tank</b>: To avoid condensation in the tank, keep the tank full in winter and check the deck-fill o-ring to make sure no water is getting through. Fuel tanks have a fuel pick up near the bottom of tank, it can get clogged if the tank has too much slime at the bottom. Most tanks aren't equipped with a drain, but they are useful to help remove water, dirty fuel (which sinks to the bottom) and sediment at the beggining of the season. Water in a diesel tank can cause microbial growth, brown, slimy fuel filters are a good indication of microbes. Adding a dispersant with a biocide after every fill-up is a good way to help keep the contents of the tank healthy. Dispersants 'absorb' water. Because modern diesel is not a great lubricant, using additives helps with performance.</p>

<p><b>Primary fuel filter</b>: primary fuel filters aren't integral to the engine, there are various models available on the market, all with their pros and cons. Most models have a clear bowl at the bottom, equipped with a drain and a spare port (if you want to add a water sensor). A water sensor, as its name suggests, will sound an alarm if it senses the presence of a lot of water. Diesel doesn't conduct electricity, but water does, and this is what activates the alarm. The fuel filter has to be accessible, so it is easy to check for deposits in the bowl. Fuel filters vary in flow rate, using a 10 micron filter at this stage is usually enough. A 30 micron filter as a primary leaves too much for the secondary to do. A filter that is too fine can clog up too easily. It is necessary to bleed the air out of the fuel lines (using the bleed screw near the secondary) after changing the primary filter. The air is bled via the use of the fuel feed pump. Start the engine to see if it runs, if not it may be necessary to bleed the injectors (see below).</p>

<p><b>Secondary fuel filter</b>: secondary fuel filters are integral to the engine. Each engine has its own model (unlike primaries, which many companies offer). If changing the secondary filter, it is necessary to bleed the screw between the secondary and the injectors (still on the low-pressure side). Yanmars have 1 to bleed, other engines may have more. Like for the primary filter, use the fuel feed pump to push the air out of the system.</p>

<p><b>Fuel feed pump</b>: a fuel feed is part of the low-pressure side of the fuel system. The pump sucks the fuel and helps it along through the rest of the system. The pump can be manual, or electrical (opens when engine is running). To bleed air out, loosen the bleed screw of the primary filter and press on the little arm of the pump (if mechanical) until diesel comes out. If the arm is up and that the diesel is sucked back in, this means that the pump has a problem and ought to be replaced.</p>

<p><b>Injectors</b>: injectors are part of the high-pressure side of the fuel system. They do not need to be bled after replacing the fuel filters. The only reason you would bleed the air out of the injectors, is if your engine ran out of fuel. To bleed the injectors, loosen all of the bolts (not just one) and crank the engine (not full start). Cracking will push the diesel through and it will squirt out of the injectors, when that happens close the bolts.</p>

<p><b>Cold start</b>: some diesel engines have glow plugs, which helps when starting from cold. There are two kinds of glow plugs: fast heat, and slow heat. Slow heat is common in marine diesel engines, and need 5-10 seconds to start. To start, an engine requires heat. Air compressed in the cylinders makes the engine hot. Diesels are typically harder to start in the cold.</p>

<p><b>Engine mounts</b>: engine mounts absorb the vibrations of the engine, they must be secure, able to withstand the thrust of a propeller. Typically, engine mounts consist of metal on top of a piece of rubber. Look for rust, or signs that the rubber mount is deteriorating (uneven on either side). When aligning the engine to the coupling, it may be necessary to loosen or tighten the mounts to effectively 'tilt' the engine on one side, or the other, forward, or back.</p>

<p><b>Coupling</b>: as mentioned above, the alignment of the coupling to the engine matters. When matching both plates, try metal to metal first with a feeler gauge to measure the gap between them (it should be even all around, where the two meet). A misaligned coupling wears down the cutlass bearing, the mounts and the shaft seal. If the coupling is loose, replace it. There are solid couplings and split couplings (with slot), the last is the better design, it is easier to remove.</p>

<p><b>Stuffing box</b>: there are many kinds of stuffing boxes, some are bronze housings that compress lengths of tallowed hemp packing around the shaft, others are dripless systems with rubber bellows. Traditional stuffing boxes always leak a little when the engine is running, but shouldn't leak when it isn't running, if it drips tighten the housing. Their advantage is that it is possible to change the hemp while in the water. When replacing the hemp packing, cut 3-4 separate lenghts of material that matches the diameter of the shaft, with the 'cuts' made at an angle. When inserted the packing back in the housing, stagger the cuts so they don't align.<br>No-drip stuffing boxes come in a wide variety of designs (PSS shaft seal, tides marine etc), as their names suggest they do not drip water, even when the engine is running. All PSS shaft seals have a hose that runs up and reached over the waterline so that the system can pick up water to lubricate itself. Faster boats will need to have this bit plumbed onto the engine so that water is injected automatically (the speed makes it that no water can stay into the seal).</p>

<p><b>Prop</b>: like all boat components, props are weak to salt and will eventually lose all their zinc and start to break apart. To measure the health of a prop, tap on one of the blades using a metal tool, a sound prop will sound like a bell (will ring long), while a bad prop will fall flat. Check the prop alignment by doing the stick test. Put a stick between the edge of the strut and the flat of a blade, cut to fit, and turn the prop by hand. The spacing ought to be the same for every blade. A prop with a lot of pink means it is beginning to deteriorate.</p>

<p><b>Cutlass bearing</b>: a cutless bearing lies at the bottom of the strut, it is what keeps the propeller shaft centred, and turning smoothly. It is a long bronze tube with a ribbed, rubbed inside. To check if a cutlass bearing is still good, push the propeller shaft up (at the prop end), there should be no play. If it can be moved up and down, the cutlass bearing out to be replace.</p>

<p><b>General tips:</b> If white salt crystals form round seals, it means that the joints are leaking and the gasket must be replaced. Cast iron corrodes from the inside out, outside signs include brown, rusty spots. Keep an absorbent sheet under engine, so that leaks (should there be any) can be easily identified. A 'tinkly' noise on an engine may be indicative of a broken drive plate (transmission). Never use teflon tape in fuel systems. If feeding fresh water through an engine to clear out the salt, don't feed a pressure hose directly, let the engine pull the water itself from a large bucket. A pressured hose can flood an engine. </p>
