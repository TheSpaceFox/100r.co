<p>This page is a work in progress... as we are doing this project right now.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/wiring_01.jpg' alt='a photo of a complex and mess network of wiring behind the breaker panel' loading='lazy' />

<p>Pino looks well-ordered when standing inside the cabin, but a peek behind the wall and ceiling panels reveals a nightmarish scene. The boat has fewer systems than it used to, but a lot of the old wiring is still there, tangled and trapped with other important wires. Because of this tangled mess it is difficult to see what is what. In the fall of 2022, we decided that it was time to tackle this dreaded, but necessary project.</p>

<p><b>Shore power</b>. Being connected to shore power was important for this electrical re-fit, we have to remove all the wiring on the DC side while still being able to cook and to keep Pino lit. With shower power, we can cook using our induction cooktop, and we use two bright 120V clamp lights to light up work areas.</p>

<p><b>Removing all connections from the DC breaker panel</b>. We were careful to identify each wire, adding labels as we removed them from the breaker panel. Now with all the wires free, came time to pull and tug at the many dead wires populating Pino's ceilings and walls. If all the wires to the breaker panels were free, dead wires should come up freely, right? Not if they're bound in a thick braid by electrical tape, and certainly not if they are routed through a maze of narrow pipes throughout the boat. The wires were packed in so tight that nothing would move in either direction.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/wiring_02.jpg' alt='a photo of wiring behind the breaker panel, with some of the wires disconnected from the breaker panels and lying free' loading='lazy' />

<p>The only option available to us then was to use force. We removed what little of the electrical tape we could reach, and then grabbed a wire in the center of each braid, and pulled. We only did this for wires we planned to replace(or for dead wires) because pulling would damage them.</p>

<p>Every braid had a dead wire in it that we could pull at. Eventually, if the wire didn't break, it would start to inch out of the braid. The thinner the braid, the easier it was to extract wires.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/wiring_06.jpg' alt='two characters stare at terrible wiring on a building and say, look at this shit' loading='lazy' />

<p>We found many wires with the heads cut off, sticking out at both ends of a pipe, impossible to remove. Most of the places designed to run wires were rendered unusable by old wiring. After seeing this, we decided to only run wires through parts of the boat we could see, never through pipes of any kind.</p>

<p><b>Cabin lights</b></p>

<p>Some nights at anchor, we had to watch which light was on and for how long because some would draw the battery down too much. A single light ought not to draw down the battery that much, fixing this problem was our top wiring priority. After inspection, we found that our main cabin lights had the jankiest wiring we'd ever seen, with many of lights tinned together and bound by electrical tape.</p>

<p>We would have to redo all the wiring and connections. We spent a lot of time following wires, hoping they weren't bound in a death braid somewhere in the wall (most of the lights were). We had to find new paths for many the lights, because the old paths were unusable.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/wiring_07.jpg' alt='a hand holding a potted deck light' loading='lazy' />

<p>Our friend Peter(MV Geordie) bought a bunch of LED potted deck lights for his boat, and he had a bagfull that he allowed us to draw from. We took 3 lights with plans to replace the two dome lights in the galley, and the one over the navigation table. The lights mount flush on the ceiling, the metal is high grade SS, each draws 0.6W, IP67 waterproof, and FT1 fireproof and insulated. Multiple lights can be wired in parallel, by way of waterproof connectors. These lights don't have switches, so we had to wire one in.</p> 

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/wiring_08.jpg' alt='a view inside pinos walls, with wires leading out of a switch and into a light' loading='lazy' />

<p>The two galley lights are wired in parallel and make use of the same switch. Both run back to the breaker panel with all of the other lights. The light over the navigation table will too have its own separate switch because we don't always want to have all of the lights on at the same time, the galley lights are the one exception.</p>

<p>Some of the dome lights were rusty on the inside, and the switches too suffered some corrosion.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/wiring_09.jpg' alt='a view of the inside of a dome lamp with the switch and inside showing some rust' loading='lazy' />

<p>Not all of the domes were bad, we kept most of the ones we had. We trashed two domes, but cannibalized one for its switch. The switch of those dome lights fail sometimes, and it is good to have spares.</p>

<p>We ran new wires for all of the existing lights.</p>

<p><b>Wiring</b></p>

<p>We have very few high-power DC systems on Pino, so most of the wiring is 16 AWG(main cabin lights, fans, lpg etc) , with a few systems using 12 AWG (radar, VHF etc). We used a mixture of <b>ancor</b> and <b>vertex</b> marine-grade wire designed for dry, wet and oily environments(both meet UL 1426, ABYC and US Coast Guard Charter boat (CFR Title 46) standards).</p>

<p><b>Color-coded cables</b>. The ABYC recommends some standard primary wire and cable color codes for boat wiring installation. The insulation color of the cable shows the purpose of that wire used in the boat wiring. See the table below for a list of the cable color codes for DC voltage systems:</p>

<p><b>On labelling wires</b>. When trying to make sense of all the wiring behind the walls we were very confused, because nothing was labelled or easily identifiable. Color-coding wires will make it easy to identify a wire in any part of the boat, although it means getting many spools of different-colored wires($$). We have chosen to instead rely on labelling all wires at various points. We like to label wires on a narrow piece of paper and to enclose it in gorilla tape around the wire, so it follows the wire and doesn't stick out. Enclosing the wire in tape will ensure the name doesn't get rubbed out, and that the paper doesn't fall prey to rot (using a see-through heat shrink is another possible option).</p>

<p>A wire that doesn't have the right color won't cause any electrical problems, the only downside is if the vessel is sold, a lack of color-coding may cause confusion that might lead to problems, say, using a red wire for a grounding wire instead of green.</p>

<p><b>Making good connections</b></p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/wiring_04.jpg' alt='a photo two wires tinned together' loading='lazy' />

<p>The above is an atrocity we found in Pino's ceiling. This is how a previous owner spliced some of the cabin lights together. This splice was tinned, covered in loose heat-shrink sleeve and bound by electrical tape, everything about this connection is bad.</p>

<q>The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at and repair. <br>â€” Douglas Adams</q>

<p><b>List of connection DONT's</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Never tape over connections</li>
<li>Never solder wires together, they ought to be mechanically connected</li>
<li>Never twist wires together</li>
<li>Never connect wires together with household "wire nuts"</li>
<li>Never wrap a bare wire around a terminal screw to connect wires together</li>
</ul>

<p><b>List of connection DO's</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Use terminals that are made from tin plated copper not aluminum</li>
<li>Use only plastic, not metal, clips to secure the wiring</li>
<li>Use ring terminals over spade terminals, ring terminal can't pull off</li>
<li>Use a good quality crimper that can double crimp</li>
<li>After crimping, always do a pull test(to make sure it won't come apart)</li>
<li>Always cover crimped connections with heat-actived, adhesive-lined heat shrink tubing</li>
<li>Use a heat gun for uniform heat-shrinking, an open flame will lead to uneven melting of the adhesive, distortions in the insulation and can lead to leaks, bubbles & voids</li>
</ul>

<p>Ring connectors are sized to wires, and are color-coded for each gauge size:</p>

<p><b>Pink</b> - 22-18 AWG<br>
<b>Yellow</b> - 12-10 AWG<br>
<b>Blue</b> - 16-14 AWG</p>

<p><b>Using butt connectors to splice wires?</b> We've been splicing wires together with butt connectors for a while now, but we've recently learned that it is bad practice.</p>

<q>Splicing circuits should be avoided. If splicing is necessary, it should employ a proper terminal block, and not butt connectors. Every splice in a circuit creates additional resistance, and the potential for the connection to come apart.<br>â€” David H. Pascoe, Marine Surveyor</q>

<p>Using terminal blocks when splicing wires seems to be the way to go.</p>

<p><b>The Mast</b></p>

<p>Pino has the following systems wired up through the mast: Radar, the wind meter, the spreader lights, a steaming light, and an anchor light. All of these wires run through the ceiling and up through a hole in the mast.</p>

<p>We will be removing the spreader lights, because they are too high-power and because we don't use them. During our trip across the {north pacific ocean} one of them broke off in part, it still hung from its own wires, but threatened to fall on our heads. We secured it with tape, and it has held since then. We will have to go up the mast to unscrew the wiring, so in turn we can pull it all out from the inside.</p>

<p>We plan to run new wiring for the steaming light, and in time... we'll change the halogen anchor light for an LED, and maybe change the wiring too. Changing the anchor light is tricky, we don't have mast steps and the bosun's chair won't get us high enough to see the top of the mast. In time, we'll find a way to change it.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/wiring_12.jpg' alt='pinos cabin with all the ceiling panels hanging open, full of loose wiring' loading='lazy' />

<p>All of the mast wires are connected to a gang terminal, nestled under a plate near where the mast exits the cabin top. While counting connections, we found an extra one and discovered that it was wiring for a light inside the cabin, sitting just aft of the mast. We don't use this light much, but we will wire it in anyway because it is silly to leave it like this. It is the only cabin light with a red bulb(for night sailing), and a dimmer.</p>

<p>So for now, the steaming light (now an LED), the anchor light (still a halogen) and the red cabin light (LED) will share the same power, although all will have their own breaker switches (red cabin light will be wired on the same breaker as all the other cabin lights).</p>

<p><b>Breaker Panels</b></p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/wiring_05.jpg' alt='a photo of old breaker panels stripped from the wall with their wires hanging' loading='lazy' />

<p>Overtime, we removed and added a lot of systems onboard. Before we buy a breaker panel, we have to figure out how many switches we need (we counted 16 on the DC 12v side).</p>

<p>Panel 1</p>

<ul>
<li>Solar charger</li>
<li>Bilge pump switch</li>
<li>VHF</li>
<li>USB outlets</li>
<li>Stereo</li>
<li>Inverter (??)</li>
<li>Main cabin lights (head fan?)</li>
<li>Radar</li>
</ul>

<p>Panel 2</p>

<ul>
<li>LPG</li>
<li>Chartplotter</li>
<li>Depth Sounder</li>
<li>Anchor light</li>
<li>Steaming light</li>
<li>AIS</li>
<li>Sailing instruments</li>
<li>Running lights (front + back, and compass light)</li>
</ul>

<p>Things we want in our new system:</p>

<p>A way to monitor the draw on the batteries (monitor), to combine certain systems on the same breaker with separate switches (lights and fans mainly), a way to charge both banks with the solar, and a more convenient setup for the inverter.</p>

<p>More soon...</p>
