<p>Doing maintenance and repairs yourself will bring the cost down. Offloading work to professionals if you can afford it is fine, but it's good to know how to take care of your boat. You may not always have access to workers if sailing to far-flung islands.</p>

<p>A failure to maintain items regularly will cost more later. We recommend keeping a log of the repairs, part replacements that is done to your boat. Many parts have a limited lifespan, so knowing when they were replaced last will help prevent breakages. If leaving for a big sailing trip with spares, <b>install the spare and keep the other one as the spare</b>. If you do this, you'll learn how to change the part and what tools you need to do the job.</p>

<p>Maintenance checklist:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Engine(s)</li>
    <li>The boatâ€™s hull (bottom) & topsides, electrical systems</li>
    <li>Electrical systems</li>
    <li>Plumbing</li>
    <li>Moving parts (hinges, tracks and zippers)</li>
    <li>Canvas and upholstery</li>
</ul>

<p>When doing repairs, use quality materials and products, research them thoroughly before a project instead of relying on brand names.</p>

<p>Some years will cost more than others as gear wears out.</p>

<p>Tasks like hauling-out (to get the bottom painted) is once every 2-3 years for an offshore boat, but can be every year otherwise. How often you haul out depends on your personal preference. If we want to wait longer between haul outs we paint 3 coats, otherwise 1 every year. We use ablative anti-fouling which costs about $250 to paint a 10 m yacht. Coating your prop, shaft and strut with 'prop speed' works well to keep growth off, it works well in high-growth areas (we used it in New Zealand and Japan) but it is very expensive. There is also the option of zinc paint. If your boat comes out of the water for a haul-out every year, a cheap alternative is to coat metal with zinc cream(penanten) or anhydrous lanolin. Both products are available at the pharmacy. Yard fees vary from place to place, those closer to large cities will cost more. In New Zealand, it cost us NZD$420 total, including bottom rinse, haul in and out and days to stay on the hard. While in Japan, it was about double that price for half the time spent on the hard.</p>

<p>Traveling {offshore} means more wear because the boat is under more stress. Repair and maintenance can cost between $500-800 per year for a 10 m yacht like ours. This price goes up and down depending on where we go, and what has to be replaced that year. In 2018 while in {New Zealand}, we spent around $10k on Pino (see {projects and pain}) to get it ready for {Japan} and the subsequent trip across the {North Pacific Ocean}. This was the most we'd spent in a year and was due to the purchase of a new AIS system, mainsail, throttle cables, replacement windows, top hatch, galley plumbing, replacement batteries and solar panels. We did most of the work ourselves, all except for the mainsail. Our first year was also expensive, because the boat was not outfitted for sailing offshore, we had to buy lifejackets, jacklines, a drogue, extra lines, shackles, a med-kit, extra tools, a location device, a handheld VHF, a SAT phone, foul-weather gear, engine spares etc...</p>

<p>Engines require spare parts, like oil ($25) and fuel filters ($10), they should be replaced 250 hours (300 hours on some models) or once per year, whichever is sooner. Our engine has two fuel filters, a secondary and primary. Other items that need to be replaced periodically include: water pump impellers ($40), water pump and alternator belt (15-$20), zincs (inside engine, $8 each), coolant (if fresh water cooled) shaft zinc ($16 each) etc.</p>
