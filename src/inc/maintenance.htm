<p>Doing maintenance and repairs yourself will bring the cost down. Offloading work to professionals, if you can afford it, is fine, but it's good to know how to take care of your boat because you may not always have access to workers if sailing to far-flung islands. Modern-built boats require less maintenance work than say, wooden boats. A failure to maintain items regularly will cost more later.</p>

<p>Maintenance checklist:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Engine(s)</li>
    <li>The boatâ€™s hull (bottom) & topsides, electrical systems</li>
    <li>Electrical systems</li>
    <li>Plumbing</li>
    <li>Moving parts (hinges, tracks and zippers)</li>
    <li>Canvas and upholstery</li>
</ul>

<p>Tasks like hauling-out (to get the bottom painted) doesn't happen every year (once every 2-3 years for an offshore boat). Some years will cost more than others, as gear wears out, if hardware or lines need replacing. When doing repairs, use quality materials and products, research them thoroughly before a project instead of relying on brand names.</p>
