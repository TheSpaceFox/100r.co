<p>Little Ninj is a 38 cm (15 in) tall, gray, soft-bodied ninja that lives aboard {Pino} with us. He is 16 years old, and was conceived by artist Michelle Valigura. We adopted him in 2009, and we've traveled all over the world together.</p>

<p>Ninj has been to Japan, England, Fiji, Thailand, The Marshall Islands, France, Germany, Niue, Tonga, French Polynesia, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, The Cook Islands, and Austria.</p>

<p>He is most active at night, he hosts boat parties in our absence, and often goes out on diplomatic missions when we arrive in a new port. Little Ninj was responsible for ensuring us safe passage through the forests of Cortes Island when he negotiated with Jeebaleebus, the local banana slug authority of the region.</p>

<q>Contrary to what some people believe, Ninj is not a small human child. He is bead/fiberfill-blooded, and will likely outlive us all.</q>
