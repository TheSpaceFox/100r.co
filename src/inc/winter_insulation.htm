<p>Living aboard in areas with hard winters is tricky, especially if your boat is not insulated. Condensation in lockers can damage wood, and cause rot and mold. To keep the interior dry, it's necessary to get rid of the moisture generated by cooking and breathing. To dry the space out you need to allow air from outside into the cabin, and then heat it. The heat won't stay if your boat isn't insulated, but winter isn't the time to add insulation, it's better to wait for a drier, warmer season. If you try and use adhesives in cold weather, materials won't bond to the hull.</p> 

<p>When we cook, we crack open a hatch to allow the steam to escape. We don't have room for a fan so this is our best option.</p>

<p><b>Hull</b>. The very best way to insulate a hull is polyurethane spray foam. This is how people insulate narrowboats. While insulating, it also provides extra buoyance. The foam is sprayed directly onto the inside of the hull and adheres well to most surfaces. The foam can be trimmed, and sanded. Any foam that is cut loose its waterproof properties, and ought to be sealed. Generally, the foam is covered up with panelling for a nicer, cleaner finish.</p>

<p>An alternative, is closed-cell foam that is bonded to the bare hull using self-adhesive or contact cement. Insulation must be sealed. Other options include a Reflectix and polyethelene foam sandwich (reflectix > polyethelene > reflectix) with each layers held in place with polyurethane caulk. It is difficult to this kind of insulation right, air pockets between the hull and foam from a bad installation can build up moisture, which can in turn start to grow mold.</p>

<p><b>Bilge and floor</b>. For the bilge area, keep it dry and cover the floors with carpet as insulation.</p>

<p><b>Windows</b>: The windows on our boat are another source of heat sink. We made {curtains} for each window, and plan to add a thin layer of bubble wrap in between it and the window in winter.</p>
