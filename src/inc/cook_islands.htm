<p>In early July 2017, we sailed to Rarotonga in the Cook Islands.</p>

<p>Avatiu port is very small, and mostly occupied by cargo ships. One day, one came in and its stern came very close to our bow. Sometimes they ask sailboats to move to allow the ships to dock, but they did not ask us... we wish they had. By the time the ship was here, we had our stern right near the pier and could not back any further. Rekka sat at the bow, waving to the people aboard the ship. All was fine in the end, but it was stressful to have something that big right in front of you.</p>

<p>Almost every day, kids would come and dive at the pier where we were moored. They liked to hang from our stern lines, and to sit on themâ€”this made us nervous, especially after one boy accidentally undid released one of our ropes. They would spend entire afternoons leaping into the water, laughing and playing.</p>

<p>We cycled around Rarotonga, the south side of the island has nice roads, but the east side isn't as nice, and most of the north part of the island is dotted with resorts. We enjoyed the ride anyway, stopping at a beach to enjoy the salt air and sun.</p>

<p>We left Rarotonga in mid July to sail to {Niue}.</p>
