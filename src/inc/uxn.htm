<p>Uxn is a portable 8-bit <a href='https://fabiensanglard.net/another_world_polygons/' target='_blank'>virtual computer</a> capable of running simple tools and games programmable in its own little assembly language. It is also playground to learn basic computation skills.</p>

<p>We've already started porting some of our tools like {Nasu}, {Left} and Noodle to ROMs that can be played on Uxn. All are written in <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxambly.html' target='_blank'>Uxambly</a>, the programming language for the Uxn computer. To learn more, see the <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html' target='_blank'>technical documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>Why create a smol virtual computer?</h3>

<p>We want to produce lasting versions of our tools and games, and by using simpler systems(the UxnVM is <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn/tree/master/item/src/uxn.c' target='_blank'>only 200 lines of C</a>) we can build more resilient software due to their lack of dependencies, and support older hardware when possible. The Uxn emulator is extremely simple, and can be ported to an unsupported system fairly easily. Follow the <a href='https://merveilles.town/@alderwick/106222101764116637' target='_blank'>development of Uxn on the Rasperry Pi Pico</a>.</p>

<p>As it stands today, most software is built with extreme short-sightedness, designed to be run on disposable electronics and near impossible to maintain, we decided to not participate in this race to the bottom. Our aim is to create a machine that focuses on answering the handlful of tasks we need, which is centered around building experimental audio/visual software.</p>

<p>To borrow the words of Viznut Heikkil√§ on <a href='http://viznut.fi/texts-en/permacomputing.html' target='_blank'>permacomputing</a>, we're interested in cultural and ecological permanence. "That is, how to give computers a meaningful and sustainable place in a human civilization that has a meaningful and sustainable place in the planetary biosphere".</p>

<p>Uxn is currently under development, we use #uxn on freenode to coordinate development [07-05-21].</p>
