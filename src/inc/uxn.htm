<p>Uxn is a <b>8-bit virtual stack machine</b>.</p>

<p>Uxn is a portable 8-bit virtual computer capable of running simple tools and games programmable in its own <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxambly.html' target='_blank'>esoteric assembly language</a>. It is also playground to learn basic computation skills.</p>

<p>We've already started porting {Nasu}, {Left} and Noodle to roms as native Uxn software. All are written in <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxambly.html' target='_blank'>Uxambly</a>, the programming language for the Uxn stack-machine.</p>

<p>

<p>See the <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html' target='_blank'>documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>Why create a smol virtual computer?</h3>

<p>We want to produce lasting versions of our tools and games. Using simpler and more basic tools, makes for more resilient software from their lack of dependencies, also making support for older hardware possible.</p>

<p>As it stands today, our impression is that most software is not built for long term in mind, and designed to be run on disposable electronics, all-in-all a very resource-intensive way of doing things. If we hope to survive as a species we have to build things for tomorrow, not just for today.</p>

<p>Our aim is to create a machine that doesn't try to do it all, but does the minimum that we need.</p>

<p>Like Viznut Heikkil√§, we're interested in cultural and ecological permanence. "That is, how to give computers a meaningful and sustainable place in a human civilization that has a meaningful and sustainable place in the planetary biosphere."

<p>Uxn is currently under development [07-05-21].</p>
