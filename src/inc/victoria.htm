<p>After our crossing the {north pacific ocean} in 2021 we stayed in Victoria for a little while.</p>

<p>While there, we experienced our first ever snow with the boat.</p>

<p>The winter rates here are reasonable, but prices spike up in the summer from June to October. It is one of the rare places where you can live aboard. The marina is very accomodating. They have a bin for compost, and a little boat goes around every week to suck up the waste from each slip (we had no need of this service, because we had a {dry toilet}).</p>

<p>Showers and laundry are a short 10 minute walk away.</p>

<p>There are plenty of groceries and around, and farmer's markets in the summer.</p>

<p>There are also bulk food stores, like Bulk Barn and Zero Waste Emporium. Emporium is more expensive, but sells fresh tofu without packaging. They also sell bulk concentrated laundry detergent. The area has lots of thrift stores, and used book stores (Russell books).</p>

<p>There are often otters on the docks, they are very cute, but they like to shit on dock lines and if you have a swim grid, they will occupy it in your absence. Lacking a swim grid, we did not mind them. During the day we could hear them swimming around the boat.</p>

<p>Our favorite part about being here, is the walks. We like waking through Beacon Hill Park and over to Dallas Road. In calm weather we enjoy walking along the breakwater, on the concrete blocks on the north side.</p>

<p>During stormy weather, taking the Holland Point Park shoreline trail to watch the breakers on shore is impressive.</p>

<p>Because our boat was connected to shore power, we got to install christmas lights in December. The red gave Pino a very eerie look.</p>
