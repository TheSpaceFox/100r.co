<p>We do enjoy having some fizzy water now and again, but hate to have to purchase bottles for it. We decided against getting a soda stream given the fact that its bottles are proprietary and cannot be filled by anyone other than them. Making your own system is way better, and if you've got a big tank it'll last for a long, long time.</p>

<p>Here's what you'll need to get, this is also the order in which you need to connect them together:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A CO2 tank(if using a paintball CO2 tank you'll require a CGA320 to G1/2-14 adapter)</li>
    <li>A regulator</li>
    <li>1m of of vinyl tubing</li>
    <li>A ball-lock keg coupler</li>
    <li>A carbonator bottle cap</li>
    <li>A soda bottle (for carbonation with a reinforced bottom).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Notes.</b> From May 2019 to August 19th 2021, we used a 5KG tank but we got rid of it because it is too big to carry. In the summer of 2022 a friend gave us a paintball C02 tank, the perfect size for our boat. Then in March 2013, a fiend gave us the rest of his beer-making kit (wasn't going to use it finally), and so now we have 2 small kegs, another ball-lock keg coupler, and an additional paintball tank. The only part we're missing is a sort of tap, or something that can keep the pressure and that can use to dispense the fizzy water out of the kegs.</p>
