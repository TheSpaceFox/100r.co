<p>We do enjoy having some fizzy water now and again, but hate to have to purchase bottles for it. We decided against getting a soda stream given the fact that its bottles are proprietary and cannot be filled by anyone other than them (although nowadays you can get fittings to make that possible). Making your own system is way better, and if you've got a big tank it'll last for a long, long time.</p>
