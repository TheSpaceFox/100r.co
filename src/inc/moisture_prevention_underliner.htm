<p>In winter, living on a plastic boat means having to fight condensation. {Insulation} plays a bit part in limiting condensation, but allowing air to flow is just as important.</p>

<p>We got sheets of high-strength mesh material called Hypervent(although there are many alternatives to this) that helps elevate cushions, promoting good air flow which can help reduced condensation as well mildew/mold growth. Note that this is not a cheap option, but is useful to protect newly re-upholstered cushions.</p>

<p>"Made with a firm but random series of thick coiled polypropylene strands that create a firm, but mainly open space so that damp air can easily be vented. The woven mat is affixed to a light synthetic fabric layer providing a smooth surface that a mattress or cushion can rest on."</p>

<p>The material can be cut larger than the cushion width and length on sides that come into contact with the hull so that air can flow all around the cushion.</p>

<p>This material is lightweight, and is easy to cut with scissors(although Hypervent isn't super uniform so making perfectly straight cuts isn't easy). When cutting little bits of stiff material will come off.  Sheets are a maximum of 99cm (39 in) wide, but can be joined together to cover the size of a cushion.</p>

<p>Even with this material in place, lifting the cushions once in a while to let them air out is good practice.</p>
