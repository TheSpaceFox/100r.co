<p>In winter, living on a plastic boat means having to fight condensation. {Insulation} plays a bit part in limiting condensation, but allowing air to flow is just as important.</p>

<p>We've done without underliners for the past 3 years (now December 2023), but this year we wanted to try something different. We got a sheet of high-strength mesh material that helps elevate cushions, promoting good air flow which can help reduced condensation as well mildew/mold growth. This material is made from a series of thickly-coiled polypropylene strands, which creates a firm but open surface through which air can flow(presumably...). The woven mat is topped by a light synthetic fabric layer that provides a smooth surface for a cushion to rest on.</p>

<p>The material can be cut larger than the cushion width and length on sides that come into contact with the hull so that air can flow all around the cushion.</p>

<p>This material is lightweight, and can be cut with scissors. When cutting little bits of stiff material will come off, be sure to scoop those up afterwards. Sheets are a maximum of 99cm (39 in) wide and 19 mm(3/4 in) thick, but can be joined together to cover the size of a berth. When trying to fit cushion measurements on two 99cm(39 in) adjoined sheets, try to keep the 'seam' somewhere convenient, that won't break off easily. For instance, for the v-berth cushion we adjoined two sheets, and split the largest V-shaped cushion in two, with the seam in the center.</p>

<p>Even with this material in place, lifting the cushions once in a while to let them air out is good practice. We will be testing this material this year to see if it keeps our berths dry.</p>

<p><b>Alternatives:</b></p>

<p>There are many similar products on the market. All are also polypropylene-based meshes, ranging in thickness and price, used in gardening or in construction. After much research we have found those options are mostly available in the US, not in Canada(we haven't looked outside of North America).</p>

<p>Many of the options listed below are thinner than 19 mm(3/4 in), but we found some up to (11.45 mm|0.45 in), the only issue is that they're sometimes sold in rolls of 30 m(100 ft). It may be a good option to pair up with someone to get a roll.</p>

<p><b>Search Keywords</b>: Look for 'aeration pads'(for potted plants on a deck, Home Depot), 'green roof drainage', wall ventilation mat' or 'rain screens'(Home Depot, they tend to be thin, 10 mm|1/4 in thick, but maybe can be bound together to create more thickness), or 'wall drainage mats'(See Enkadrain).</p>

<p><b>Notes</b>. What we have is a <a href="../media/content/boat_projects/hypervent_compare.jpg">Hypervent knock-off</a>. There are many similar products on the market, ranging in price, we chose this one not because we think it is the best, but because it's thick, it is what was available locally, and what was within reasonable walking distance of our mooring spot. Hopefully this will be useful to protect newly re-upholstered cushions (we will report here on how well it performs).</p>
