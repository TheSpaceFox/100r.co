<p>Coastal locations like marinas and public beaches often have fresh water showers for local swimmers or marina guests. Usually free, or available for use at a nominal fee (1-2$ for 5 minutes).</p>
<p>We use a pressurized sprayer as a shower, it uses little water and can be found in most hardware stores. We don't use soap.</p>
<p>When water is scarce, we <b>bathe in salt water, and rinse with fresh water</b>.</p>
