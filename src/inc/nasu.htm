<p><b>Nasu</b> is a spritesheet editor created to help us design and assemble the assets of our famicom games. It can both import and export <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/chr_format' target='_blank'>.chr spritesheets</a>. The viewport displays the project tiles, each tile is 8 by 8 pixels and each pixel is one of 4 colors.</p>

<p>If you wish to learn more about creating 8bit projects, see our {6502 Assembly} notes. To learn more about Nasu, have a look at the <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/nasu/' target='_blank'>operation manual</a>.</p>

{story}

<h2><a id='distributions'>Distributions</a></h2>

<p>Nasu is available as a <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/nasu/' target='_blank'>standalone application written in portable C89</a>. It is distributed as a single file C file that build into a <b>20kb</b> executable designed to runs <b>offline</b> and having only <a href='https://www.libsdl.org/'>SDL2</a> as dependency.</p>

<p>The application was initially built to help with porting of {Donsol} to the Famicom, and later evolved to include the features of the drawing software <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvO5JRF47bc&feature=emb_title'>Noodle</a>. It is currently used to create both Famicom projects such as Spacetime, and various assets for {Dotgrid} and {Orca}>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you don't wish to build the C89 version yourself, and have access to a reliable internet connection, you can use <a href='https://hundredrabbits.github.io/Nasu/' target='_blank'>Nasu in your browser</a>.</p>
