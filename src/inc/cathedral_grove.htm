<p>On a very grey day, we went on a non-boating adventure with our friend Hellien. We took a trip north and went to visit some giant fir trees in Cathedral Grove.</p>

<p>Some of the trees we met there are more than 800 years old and 9 metres (30 ft) in circumference, not enough for the three of us to encircle hand to hand.</p>

<p>There were a lot of downed giant trees, a result of the last great windstorm that struck the area in 1997. Now the trees are laying over their sides, resting, while providing local insects, birds and other small animals with nutrients and shelter.</p>

<p>Qualicum, or Xwkwaâ€™luxwum in Pentlatch language, are a type of local wind system. Every 20 to 40 years or so, a very strong Qualicum blows through the area, obliterating the landscape.</p>

<q>When a high pressure ridge forms on the west side of Vancouver Island, a southwesterly inflow funnels through Port Alberni Inlet, across the island through a gap in the mountains, finally emerging as strong outflow winds into the Strait of Georgia.</q>

<p>Most of the trees were covered in green moss, making them look thick and fuzzy. We saw many varieties of moss, like Witch's hair (Alectoria sarmentosa) and sphagnum moss (has the ability to store up to 25 times its dried weight in water).</p>

<p>We also found lots of species of lichen, like lettuce lichen (lobaria oregana). Lettuce lichen loves to grow on Douglas Fir trees.</p>

<p>Everything there felt moist, and alive.</p>
