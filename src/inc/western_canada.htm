<h3>2016</h3>

<p>We bought {Pino} in North Saanich, British Columbia, Canada in 2016. After that, we explored a few spots in the Gulf Islands.</p>

<p>We spent our first night off grid at Sidney Spit, tethered to one of the many BC Parks mooring buoys. It was March then, still plenty cold. We left North Saanich marina in April, and began exploring the Gulf Islands. We also visited Vancouver, staying in False Creek for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Our time exploring was cut short, because we began our preparations for sailing south, and our cruising in Canada stopped there.</p>

<h3>2020</h3>

<p>We returned to British Columbia in August 2020 after our {north pacific ocean} crossing from {Japan}.</p>

<p>In winter, we settled in the {Victoria} Inner Harbor to get re-acquainted with life near land after 51 days at sea, and to fix up our vessel. During our stay on those docks, we installed a {woodstove} and made ourselves a hanging double {bed} (we're so proud of that bed).</p>

<p>Then in early 2021, we started having engine issues. We purchased a set of {oars} to get us out of the Victoria Inner Harbor with a backup to our defective engine, and made our way north to North Saanich for a haul-out. We removed 5 {thruhulls} while on the hard, added {insulation} to the v-berth, and built a {dry toilet}. Our good friends Rik and Kay lent us their slip in their marina while they were sailing around Vancouver Island, so we stayed there while troubleshooting our engine. We discovered the issue (for more details, see {engine rebuild}).</p>

<p>Sadly, we only got off the dock to start cruising on August 4th, armed with a new-to-us rebuilt freshwater cooled engine. We used that time to explore places in the Gulf Islands we'd never been to.</p>
