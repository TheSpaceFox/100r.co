<p>We bought {Pino} in North Saanich, British Columbia, Canada in 2016. After that, we explored a few spots in the Gulf Islands.</p>

<p>We spent our first night off grid at Sidney Spit, tethered to one of the many BC Parks mooring buoys. It was March then, still plenty cold. We left North Saanich marina in April, and began exploring the Gulf Islands. We also visited Vancouver, staying in False Creek for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Our time exploring was cut short, because we began our preparations for sailing south, and our cruising in Canada stopped there.</p>

<p>We returned to British Columbia in August 2020 after our {north pacific ocean} crossing from {Japan}.</p>

<p>In winter, we settled in the {Victoria} Inner Harbor to get re-acquainted with life near land after 51 days at sea, and to fix up our vessel (see {boat projects}).</p>

<p>In May 2022, we left Victoria with plans to visit Desolation Sound for the first time. We spent 3 months there.</p>

<p>Everytime we visit a new place, we'll update our notes here:</p>
