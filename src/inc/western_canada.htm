<p>We bought {Pino} in North Saanich, British Columbia, Canada in 2016. After that, we explored a few spots in the Gulf Islands.</p>

<p>We spent our first night off grid at Sidney Spit, tethered to one of the many BC Parks mooring buoys. It was March then, still plenty cold. We left North Saanich marina in April, and began exploring the Gulf Islands. We also visited Vancouver, staying in False Creek for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Our time exploring was cut short, because we began our preparations for sailing south, and our cruising in Canada stopped there.</p>

<p>We returned to British Columbia in August 2020 after our {north pacific ocean} crossing from {Japan}.</p>

<p>In winter, we settled in the {Victoria} Inner Harbour to get re-acquainted with life near land after 51 days at sea, and to fix up our vessel (see {boat projects}).</p>

<p><b>Summer 2021 route:</b> Victoria > Cadboro Bay > North Saanich > Genoa Bay > Montague ({Galiano}) > Lyall Harbour (Saturna Island) > North Saanich > Victoria. <b>Note.</b> We had engine problems that year, so we didn't cruise around too much. See {engine rebuild}. We also did a lot of {boat projects}, like installing our {woodstove}, our {dry toilet} and dealing with {thruhulls}.</p>

<p><b>Summer 2022 route:</b> Victoria > Sidney > Glenthorne Passage (Prevost Island) > Montague ({Galiano}) > North Cove (Thetis Island) > Nanaimo > Secret Cove > Pender Harbour > {sturt bay} Texada Island > {Grace harbour} > {Melanie Cove} > Refuge Cove > {hathayim marine park} > Melanie Cove > {Tenedos Bay} > Sturt Bay > Bargain Bay (Setchel Peninsula > {Gabriola} (Silva Bay) > Montague (Galiano) > Lyall Harbour (Saturna Island) > Sidney > Montague > Sidney > Cadboro Bay > Victoria.</p>

<p><b>Summer 2023 route (thus far)</b>:</b> Victoria > North Saanich > Glenthorne Passage (Prevost Island) > Montague ({Galiano}) > Glenthorne Passage > Westport Boatyard > Genoa Bay > {Maple Bay} > {Telegraph Cove} (Thetis Island) > {Gabriola} (Silva Bay) > {Smuggler Cove} (Setchel Peninsula) > Pender Harbour > {Princess Louisa Inlet} > Baker Bay (Hotham Sound) > Thunder Bay > {Sturt Bay} (Texada Island) > Roscoe Bay (West Redonda Island) > {Melanie Cove} > {hathayim marine park} > Heriot Bay(Quadra Island).</p>
