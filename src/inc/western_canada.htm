<p>We bought {Pino} in North Saanich, British Columbia, Canada in 2016. We left in August 2016 to circumnavigate the Pacific Ocean. We returned to our home waters in August 2020 after our {north pacific ocean} crossing from {Japan}.</p>

<h3><a id='vhf'>VHF channels</a></h3>

<p>Use <b>66A</b> to contact marinas.</p>

<p>The Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) provides continuous service (monitoring, response, weather alerts) on VHF channel 16 (156.8 MHz), and on 2182 kHz MF. WX for weather forecasts, with forecasts broadcasted 4 times daily at 0400, 1030, 1600 and 2130. The forecasts shared at these hours are very general, and may not represent conditions accurately everywhere(in many places wind is affected by land). More accurate forecasts are broadcasted throughout the day via lighthouses, automated stations and buoys, find the closest one to your location.</p>

<h3><a id='currentstides'>Currents and Tides</a></h3>

<p><b>Current</b>. The waters of the Georgia Basin are protected from the worst of the weather by Vancouver Island, but any large sheltered body of water dotted with hundreds of tightly-nested islands is subject to big tidal movements. A lot of water moves in and out of both Queen Charlotte Strait(north of Vancouver Island) and the Juan de Fuca Strait(south of Vancouver island).</p>
<p>Currents in narrow passages between islands can reach dangerous speeds(current at Seymour Narrows can reach 16 knots on a large flood) especially during spring tides. Learn to use tide tables and transit at slack tide.</p>

<p><b>Tides</b>. The waters of Western Canada have a 2.6-5 m (8.5-16ft) tidal range. The higher the latitude the bigger the tidal exchange. Check the high tide level when anchoring to avoid underscoping. Desolation Sound, an area laying between the north and south, doesn't have a lot of water exchange because north of Mittlenatch Island the water begins to flood south, and ebbs north. Because the water doesn't move as far the water there is warmer than anywhere else in BC (ideal for swimming in the summer).</p>

<h3><a id='windweather'>Wind and Weather</a></h3>

<img src="../media/content/travel/pl_24.jpg">

<p>Large scale regional weather(Pacific High in the summer) determines the general wind patterns in British Columbia, but local land features can also create localized wind patterns. The many fjords and inlets populating this coast act as tunnels carrying winds to and from the coast known as inflow and outflow winds.</p>

<p><b>Summer</b>. Daytime heat from the sun heats up the land and mountains and creates see-breezes and anabatic winds(a warm wind which blows up a steep slope/mountain) that flow from the cool water toward the warmer land as an inflow. At night in summer when the land cools by radiating energy to space, the opposite happens where katabatic winds(wind moving downward because of cooling, esp. at night) combine with land-breezes to channel colder air from the cold land to ward the water as an outflow.</p>

<p><b>Winter</b>. Cold arctic air masses moving into the BC interior, creates strong high pressure east of the coast-range mountains. But lower pressure is often on the other side of the mountains, over the Pacific coast. The resulting pressure difference pushes air from the interior of BC through the valleys and fjords to the coastline as a very strong winter outflow wind. The leading edge of a strong outflow can bring clouds, rain, or even snow with it, followed by clear skies.</p>

There is really too much to say about winds on this coast, we highly recommend the book <b>Taken by the Wind, The Northwest Coast</b> by Marilyn Johnson to understand it in detail.</p>

<h2><a id="summerroutes">Our Summer Sailing Routes</a></h2>

<p>Since 2020 we've spent our winters on the {Victoria} docks, and summers cruisings in the Salish Sea. Dotted lines indicate the return trip, with some overlap with the starting routes.</p>
