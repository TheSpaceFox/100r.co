<p>As of June 19th 2021, we are still in the process of building our composting toilet. The first step was to remove the old raw water head, piping and the {thruhulls}.</p>

<p>We painted the area under the old marine head, and cut out a piece of the floor to fit the liquids tank. The tank needs to be lower to accommodate the height of the urine diverter. If we did not make a hole, the toilet would be too high for us to sit on.</p>

<p>We fibreglassed (and painted) some supports on the sides of the hole to level the tank. Our head is near the bow, and the floor has a very extreme angle.</p>

<p>For the liquids, we calculated that for two people for a full week, we would need a 31 L tank. Of course, some days we don't urinate as much as other days, but that tank would allow for that odd week where we exceed normal amounts. We visited Industrial Plastics and Paints in Victoria and found a 27 L (6 CDN Gal) tank. It is smaller than we had planned, but because we overcalculated the first amount we think that this will work out fine. We had them put a fitting overtop so we can close the tank while underway.</p>

<p>To empty the tank, we'll connect a foot pump to it to transfer it into a smaller 5 L carry container to dump in a public toilet, or in the sea when far from shore. When underway, we might just get a long hose and pump it directly overboard from the forward hatch, we are not sure yet. We could have kept a thru-hull to empty it out, but preferred to close it.</p>

<p>We bought a Forian porcelain urine diverter by <a href='https://urineseparator.com/' target='_blank'>Shit and Blossoms</a> to keep the liquids and solids separate. We chose porcelain because of its durable and hygienic properties. Very few companies offer the option of a porcelain separator, it is easy to clean and will last for a long, long time.</p>

<p>For solids, we got a 20 L tank with a cover (to close it in rough waters). We plan to use wood chips sourced from a landscaping company in Victoria. We keep it in a bag with a scoop.</p>

<p>We are currently building a cover for the tank out of plywood. Everything on a boat is crooked, every space is like a weird trapezoid prism, everything has to be measured 10 times. We kept the toilet seat from our old marine head and will re-use it for our composting head. We have plans to later install a fan, we carry many 12-V computer fans aboard that we can use for this purpose.</p>
