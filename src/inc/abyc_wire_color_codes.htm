<p><b>Color-coded cables</b>. The ABYC recommends some standard primary wire and cable color codes for boat wiring installation. The insulation color of the cable shows the purpose of that wire used in the boat wiring. See the table below for a list of the cable color codes for DC voltage systems:</p>

<p><b>On color-coding wires</b>. Trying to make sense of wiring on a new-to-you vessel when nothing is labelled or easily identifiable is painful experience. Color-coding wires will make it easy to identify a wire in any part of the boat.</p>

<p>Surveyors won't lose their heads if the colors are wrong (although sticking to black and red for pos and neg is crucial), but it is at least good to label the wires at various points. We like to label wires on a narrow piece of paper and to enclose it in gorilla tape around the wire, so it follows the wire and doesn't stick out. Enclosing the wire in tape will ensure the name doesn't get rubbed out, and that the paper doesn't fall prey to rot (using a see-through heat shrink is another possible option).</p>

<p>A wire that doesn't have the right color won't cause any electrical problems, the only downside is if the vessel is sold, a lack of color-coding may cause confusion that might lead to problems, say, using a red wire for a grounding wire instead of green.</p>
