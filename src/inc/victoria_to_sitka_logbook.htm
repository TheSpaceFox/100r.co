<p>On the passage from <b>{Victoria}</b> to <b>{Sitka}</b> we traveled 1,800 NM, the journey lasting from May 1st to August 11th. Rek kept a logbook of our travels, to help me remember when we did what, the conditions we encountered, etc. We decided to publish them online so that other sailors, as well as those that are curious, can see what it is like to sail in these reef-emcumbered, occasionally fast-flowing, waters..</p>

    <td><b>{Victoria} to Sidney</b><hr><br>I awoke to an awful sound, an alarm ringing at 0540. Devine had been waking up at 0600 every second day all year to go to the gym, they got up quickly, but I hadn't been trained for this. The morning was rude, my body didn't want to leave the bed — it had taken us so long to build up this much warmth! My body also knew that current waits for no one, and so, without waiting for my eyes to open, my legs crawled out of the blankets, and out the rest of me came, ragdolling out of bed and into the cold.<br>We got dressed, then made sure that everything aboard was secured for our sail to Sidney. We're always forgetful when we haven't sailed in a while. In the winter, the boat is still, so still that it becomes part of the land. {Pino} sways at the dock in heavy winds, but nothing threatens to fall over, the motion is never violent. Now, each item must go back to its assigned spot, lashed down.<br>There is light outside at this hour, it helps, but waking before the birds is not right. As soon as we moved outside, Peter, our dock neighbor and good friend, was there to greet us. Peter, like myself, doesn't share Devine's early hour waking habit, but he knew we were leaving, and made an effort to be there to say goodbye. Even at this early morning hour, Peter looked as dapper as ever, Peter, who goes to the gym in corduroy pants and button down shirts. We hug, and he helps us push off.</td>

    <td>Pino glided away from the dock on calm waters, propelled by Calcifer II. Our departure awoke another neighbor, Gunther, he was outside and he too waved us off, "where are you going again?" he asked. "Alaska!" we whisper-shouted back as we drifted past — it was early, we didn't want to make more noise than necessary. The little ephemeral floating community we've found is precious, like birds returning to land to nest every year, we all gather in the fall, and come spring, everyone flies away. Some birds return to the nest, others don't, drawn by the allure of distant lands.<br> A light breeze greeted us at the mouth of the outer Victoria Harbour, we hoisted Pino's wings inside the calm of the breakwater. The wind was not strong enough to push us by itself, Calcifer II continued to provide help.</td>

<tr>  
    <td>Last winter, we built our own {gimballed stove}, we tried it for the first time underway — all went well. I toasted bread in our heavy cast iron pan, then coated one side of the crunched-up exterior with peanut butter. While we ate our breakfast, I boiled water to thin the moka pot coffee, doing this fools us into thinking there is more coffee to drink. Devine always grinds the whole beans, I passed the grinder to them outside. Devine was steering the boat, tiller tucked between their legs. We modified our tiller head too for this year's trip, it was now low enough that we could steer like this, it freed our hands for other tasks, like grinding coffee beans. When the water in the kettle was hot, I switched it for the moka pot and completed our breakfast routine. The boat wasn't heeling enough for this to be a good first test for our stove, but the unit worked.</td>

<tr>
    <td>When we turned into Haro Strait, the wind left us, as is tends to do in this area. The wind only ever bends around the corner when the wind blows hard. Now, the water was full of small fishing boats. We laughed, seeing the number of gulls at their heels. Each boat had its own little gull fan club. Some gulls were resting on the cabin tops, the rest were in the water, paddling around, and waiting for scraps or for space to free up on the boat. We wondered how the people aboard those boats felt about the gulls, are they friends that they look forward to returning to when on the water? Did they give them names? Or were they a terrible nuisance?</td>

    <td>The wind returned south of James Island, we rode it into Sidney, arriving at 1100</td>

    <td><b>Sidney to Montague</b><hr><br>The alarm rang at 0600, we snoozed until 0640. We left at 0800 to catch the current north to our next anchorage. After pushing off the dock, we pulled onto another to pick up some diesel. We filled four 20 L bins. We hoped the wind would be a frequent companion on our trek north, so we wouldn't have to burn through these too fast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>  
    <td>The wind was blowing out of the northeast, but we only felt it once past Portland Island. It was coming out of where we needed to go, but as strange as it sounds to those unacquainted with the physics of sailing, a sailboat can work with this. We tightened the sheets and sailed into the wind. Devine read through a book about Southeast Alaska anchorages while I, at the tiller, counted cormorants in the water. We saw a group of 30 near Portland Island, with a few gulls in the mix, looking very out of place because unlike cormorants, who's bodies are below the water, gulls float on the surface.<br>
    We played dodge-the-ferries, while tacking northward until the breeze became to weak to sail with — close-hauled sailing requires a good strong wind. Calcifer II carried us the rest of the way to Montague. We arrived at 1300. Tacking had added 3 nautical miles to our trip. Sailing into the wind is definitely not the quickest way forward, you can't be in a hurry... but the issue with sailing in these waters is that time matters because of current. When it turns against you, progress is slow, and depending on the strenght of the current it can stop you outright. If the wind isn't with you, with a current running, progress is a beautiful dream. Our motor can carry us through <i>some</i> current, but it feels like throwing money into the ocean.</td>

<tr>
    <td>We arrived in Montague, dropping our anchor in 35 ft. 20 minutes after anchoring, a large motor boat came into the anchorage and dropped their anchor very near ours. There was plenty of room elsewhere. "A strange choice," we said. Pino is like a shiny lure, drawing the attention of bigger fish.<br>Inside the cabin, we picked up a few disobedient items that had rolled out of their spots. Some items had found the floor, "this isn't your room," I said, remembering the classic line said by Tom Hanks to a dog in Turner and Hooch. Sometimes I fear that too many of my words. are borrowed from films.<br>We prepared basmati rice with sauteed sweet potatoes, tofu, and greens, seasoned with soy sauce and mirin, with a side of miso soup.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>That night, we continued reading The Martian by Andy Weir. In the book, Mark Whatney must be self-sufficient, he must ration his food to survive. With our upcoming trip, we don't have to ration, our time away from others won't span 4 years, but we do need to be cautious with both food and water. At sea, Pino must be an island.</td>

    <td><b>Montague</b><hr><br>The wind was too light to sail, so we waited in Montague for an extra day. Avi sent us a message, asking if we'd like to go see the Recycling Center's new plastic crusher and press. We rowed Teapot to shore and met Avi at the dinghy dock, he gave us a ride to the Recycling Center.</td>

<tr>
    <td>The new machines transformed plastic waste into new materials, which locals can use to produce art, for construction, or to make replacement parts at home. Same type plastics are gathered — polypropylene, polystyrene, etc. The shredder reduces the plastic into smaller pieces, and a separate machine, a heated hydraulic press, softens and merges the bits into a solid sheet. The size of the sheet depends on the amount of shredded plastic, and the sheet thickness(adjustable with the press). Mixing different colored plastics results in a gorgeous mandala daubed with bright and glaring patterns. Ading a single shredded bottle of yellow mustard creates amazing contrast. The sheet of plastic ressembled a painting, born of plastic waste, which people can cut down, or drill through.<br>Previously, Galiano Island was exporting all of its plastic waste to the Vancouver mainland, a lot of it now stays on the island, given a second, and hopefully lasting purpose.<br>The recycling center is across from a building that accepts second hand goods, all from residents of Galiano. The center separates all recyclables so they are better processed — just like in Japan. The rest of British Columbia doesn't discern between different kinds of plastics, it also doesn't recycle glass... which is... insane.</td>

    <td><b>Montague to Secretary Islands</b><hr><br>0830 departure from {Galiano} Island, with the goal of stopping either at a bight between the Secretary Islands, or at Clam Bay, a short 10 NM sail away. We needed an anchorage that offers protection from both the SE and NW — a tall order in these waters, given the fact that most bays have either a SE or NW orientation. Montague fits that description, but it was too far south, we wanted to be near Porlier Pass to exit at slack current come morning.<br>The Secretary Islands anchorage was on the way to Clam Bay, we had never been there, but we would go by to check it out, to see if it was suitable for an overnight stay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The wind was in our faces the entire way, 5-10 kn out of the northwest, it lessened as we neared our destination. The bight between the Secretary Islands was open to the north, and we suspected that northwest winds could creep in through Porlier Pass to affect it, but we decided to chance it.<br>We set our anchor in 20 ft of water, in mud. The northwest wind was curling around the corner, as expected, but only the stronger gusts. The winds later rose to 15-20 kn, but would lessen as the day went on, before dying entirely. It was supposed to turn to the southeast overnight, and to build up come Sunday morning into, hopefully, a strong enough breeze to carry us across the strait. It was likely that we would have endured these same wind conditions in Clam Bay. Clam Bay is full of debris, old crab pots, disused aquaculture gear, it is not our favorite spot. The unnamed bight in the Secretary Islands was a welcome change.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>At 1400, the forecast was upgraded to a strong wind warning, with winds from 20-30 kn in the strait — not a fun surprise. The anchorage became more rolly, with the boat yawing with the coming waves, we both felt sea sick. Like before, only the strong gusts penetrated our little bight, but the waves curled around the corner and invaded our space. I added a bit more scope on our anchor rode as a precaution. Devine took a nap, working on the computer in these conditions was too difficult. I wanted to nap too, to rid myself of a headache, but I preferred to keep watch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Later, the forecast changed yet again, down to 15-25 kn. The waves became tolerable, cooking dinner without fear of feeling sick would be possible. I cooked some sticky brown rice with a topping of sweet and sour chickpeas with crushed peanuts on top. The wind was angry in the strait, but it wasn't felt as strongly here. The wind left entirely at 1700, allowing us to sleep well. We are always grateful when the wind goes to sleep too.</td>

    <td><b>Secretary Islands to {Smuggler Cove}</b><hr><br>We awoke to an even quieter quiet. A lonely log drifted past, a bald eagle sat atop a bare tree top, a dog on the northern island barked, the echo distorted the sound, making it appear like it belonged to a larger, more ferorious animal.<br>We left our unnamed nook at 0830. We motored towards Porlier Pass to catch slack tide. Porlier Pass can run fast at peak current, but like all rapids, when timed right, the waters are smooth. Today, the waters were undisturbed. We passed a log supporting 12 black-headed gulls, we named them: the black-headed gull syndicate. This log was <i>the</i> place to be, this is where shady decisions in the black-headed gull world happened.<br>A small fishing boat idled in the pass in the shallows, we glided past them, hoping to find a rippled sea in the strait. Ripples were indicative of wind. The forecast had been unreliable, what was supposed to be 10-15 kn out of the southeast, turned into wind that was supposed to die entirely at 1000, not long after our exit from Porlier Pass. Wind was forecast in the north part of Georgia Strait, so we thought we'd go out and see for ourselves. We spotted a band of darker water on the horizon, there <i>was</i> wind out there, but we had to push further away from the shore to reach it. We met with the rippled band of water, hoping that it would stay rippled, it did, with many more bands ahead!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Our plan was to skirt along the length of Galiano Island, if the wind did not manifest we would duck into Gabriola(another island, further north). The wind stayed, so we pushed on.<br>10-15 kn winds out of the southeast carried us all the way across. The wind did lessen at times, but it always increased again to fill our sails. The day started grey, and stayed grey. Our new rain jackets saw their first rain today. Our former foulweather gear would get wet and stay wet, making any sail in the rain uncomfortable, now, our new vinyl bibs and jackets will keep us dry. Although, keeping our hands dry and warm at the same time is always a problem.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
    <td>It was hard to see the Vancouver mainland with this rain. In the absense of a visual reference, we had to follow our compass. We took turns steering Pino, when we spend long days on the water we have to give the other time to rest, to warm up. Most Alaska-bound sailors favor boats with enclosed cockpits, but Pino's cockpit is always exposed to the weather. Both of us were dry, but cold, we hadn't layered on enough clothes. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Spending a day in the rain was tiring. We arrived in Smuggler's Cove at 1600, a Nordic Tug was stern-tied inside the first bay. The rain increased as we motored inside. We dropped the hook in the middle basin, not bothering to stern-tie to shore because it was raining, and because we were both too hungry and tired.<br>Devine fired up the woodstove while I secured gear in the cockpit and on deck, determined not to have to go back out there once I tasted the warmth of the cabin.<br>We ate a hearty rice noodle soup, it warmed our insides, while the woodstove took care of our outer shells. Our plan for tomorrow was to move to Pender Harbour to stop at the grocery store. In our haste to leave for the summer, we forgot to stock up on a few key ingredients, like olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. The grocery store there had excellent baguettes in stock.<br>A singlehanded sailor came into the anchorage at 1900, he decided to stern-tie, even if there was room, even if it was raining buckets... a brave, brave person.</td>

    <td><b>Smuggler's Cove to Pender Harbour</b><hr><br>The wind kept us up last night. Southeast winds funnel through Smuggler's Cove, that day the winds angled us towards the shore. Our swing radius was very limited in this bay, when the anchor rode was taut, we were 60 ft away from the shore. We assumed a southeast wind would point us toward the outer basin, it didn't. Swinging that close to shore doesn't ever stop being worrisome. I stayed awake, from 0100 to 0400. After 0400, the wind lessened, my anchor watch was over, I fell asleep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>We woke up at 0700. We experienced big weather while anchored in this bay before, but whenever a detail changes, like anchoring somewhere new in the same bay, it is difficult to have complete trust. Our boat is infinitely valuable to us, sleeping badly is a small price to pay, and we can catch up on sleep later.<br>We could see our own breath because of the cold. We prepared whole wheat pancakes for breakfast, while firing up the woodstove. The Nordic Tug and the sailboat left before us, leaving us alone in the cove for a short time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>We left Smuggler's Cove at 0930, riding the tide up to Pender Harbour, a short 10 NM hop away. The sun came out during our transit, warming our bodies, a reminder that the world could be warm, that it could have color in it. Some clouds drew shapes on Texada Island, while others, heavy with water, threatened to burst. We spied a large cloud with a skirt of rain, south of us, the wind was helping it along, it too had Pender Harbour in sight. We hoped to arrive before it reached us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Pino found a spot on the Pender Harbour public dock at 1130. We went to pick up a few items at the grocery store. The Nordic Tug, and the sailboat from this morning were here. Motorboats always arrive in port first. "Where are you going?" The captain of the Nordic Tug asked us as he was getting ready to push off the dock again. "North." We said. "Us too!"<br>An RCMP twin-hulled motor vessel came to dock behind us, casting a very large shadow over Pino, making our strong sailing bird appear frail. It ran its engine at the dock until 2000. Even with its stern away from us, the roar of the engine resounded between the two hulls and attacked our ear drums. We couldn't tell the RCMP to shut down their engine, or at least, we didn't dare to. The quiet after 2000 was nice. We tucked into bed early, continuing to read The Martian.</td>

    <td><b>Pender Harbour to {Ballet Bay}</b><hr><br>The rumbling of the RCMP boat engine resumed at 0600. It's fine, we were both awake by then anyway...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>The plan was to skip north to Ballet Bay on Nelson Island, if the wind cooperated we would try to ride it up to an anchorage further north. We always leave with backup anchorages in mind, some if the wind is helpful, others if it isn't. The wind was coming out of the northwest, we tacked into it to infinity. We hadn't plug into shore power while at the dock, so using an electric heater to warm the boat that morning was not possible, and running the woodstove at a dock wouldn't be very kind to our neighbors.<br>We forgot to buy a small axe while in Victoria, we considered looking for one in Pender Harbour but there were no hardware stores within reasonable walking distance — much of British Columbia is car-centric. We will try to find one in Port McNeill, a city near the top of Vancouver Island. It would be nice to have it to split our own kindling for our woodstove, wood sold in stores is usually not sized for our little 23x23 cm firebox. Mornings are very cold aboard Pino, we need wood to stay comfortable. Morning coffee doesn't stay warm for long in such temperatures.</td>
</tr>
<tr> 
    <td>We left the dock at 1000. The wind funneled strait into the harbour, giving us clear signs that there was a lot of weather out there. We put a reef in the main, beating to weather under a full sail is really sporty, and we know we handle this kind of wind better with one reef in. We inched out of the harbor by motor, and sailed as soon as we cleared the outermost island. As expected, we had to tack very near to Texada Island, the island that borders the other side of the channel, to make any progress northward. One coast fades away while the other comes into focus, then on the next tack, we get to see details come in and fade away again. We had to tack 6 times to bring Pino in line with the entrance to Ballet Bay, our planned anchorage of the day. If we had gone to Ballet Bay in a straight line, the path would have been much shorter(12 NM), but zigzagging over long distances adds a lot of miles to a journey, it took us nearly 25 NM to get there today. Pino steers well when sailing to weather. The waves generated by this wind were manageable, but not small. We had a bit of water splash up on deck.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>We saw two other sailboats on the water today. One of them, a catamaran, beat us to our anchorage, while the other sailed on. At times, we were going at 6 kn, a good speed with a reef in. We can make good time with less sail, and sitting in the cockpit too is more pleasant when the rails aren't in the water. The boat was still heeling to 20 degrees at times, a good test for our gimballed stove. We have used it everyday since we left. The gimbal works well, the pot that was sitting on it stayed put.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Once we arrived into Ballet Bay, we saw that the catamaran had claimed the shallower waters, but we found a spot near them. The waters of this bay are deep, the last time we were here we dropped the anchor in 55 ft, now, the water would be 45 ft maximum at high water. The northwest wind spilled into the bay, but there weren't any waves to accompany it.<br>We prepared fancy tofu-steak sandwiches with a baguette we had picked up in Pender Harbour. I am glad we waited to arrive to eat, eating certain meals underway isn't pleasant, especially if the wind and waves are up. I feel like I have to finish the meal quickly, I don't get to enjoy it. I want to enjoy my sandwich. I <i>will</i> enjoy my sandwich!</td>
