<p>Despite owning Pino for 8 years, there are still parts we've never removed, or seen. This year we plan on cruising in Northern BC and decided to pull the boat's chainplates to see if they needed replacing.</p>

<p>Yamaha 33's (with the engine in the stern), have very long chainplates that go the deck at four points.</p>

<p>Each plate is secured to a cabin bulkhead with two beefy bolts, and then secured to a stainless steel plate that is embedded(fibreglasses) in the hull. The chainplates are sandwiched between two thick slabs, and through-bolted.It's hard to get a good look at what is securing the chainplates to the hull, but we used a mirror to show what it looks like. There is a lot of surface rust, but the metal appeared fine once all of the grime and dust was removed. <img src='../media/content/boat_projects/chainplates_05.jpg' style='float:right;' class='medium' /></p>

<p>To remove the chainplates, we tied a halyard on each side to keep the mast balanced, removed all of the cotter pins, loosened the turnbuckles attached to each chainplate, and removed the backing plate and the sealant where the chainplate enters the hull. Pulling on it by hand wasn't enough to get it out. We tied our whisker pole halyard to the end and winched it out.</p>

<p>The first chainplate looked much better after a good clean-up, but unfortunately, this revealed a bit of pit corrosion around one of the upper bolt holes. The chainplate looks good otherwise, with no stress marks, no enlargened bolt holes. The others also had the same problem, and one of them seemed to have a small crack.</p>

<p>If a length of SS exhibits pit corrosion on the surface, it is an indicator that the corrosion goes deep into the metal, and a crack is just not a good thing overall. Stainless Steel is very resistant to corrosion, but can rust when there is no oxygen(a common issue for chainplates that lie tight onto bulkheads and that are sealed at the deck to prevent water intrusion).</p>

<p>The chainplates are 8mm thick at the top(outside on deck) and bottom(metal bracket glasses on the hull), and a bit skinnier in the middle. We think they did this to save on weight. Unfortunately, we don't think it'll be possible to re-install 8mm chainplates, because no supplier in town carries metal with metric measurements. We'll likely have to size up to 9.5mm. Sizing up may mean having to enlargen some holes... but we'll see. In any case, sizing up is better than sizing down.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 6th we took a bus up to Canoe Cove and dropped off our chainplates for fabrication(they use the old ones as templates). We thought about making the chainplates ourselves, but we don't have the right tools to do the work. One of our chainplates has an angle, not something we can replicate. We expect everything to cost somewhere between 1200-1500$CAD. Just the metal costs about 400$CAD.</p>

<p>With the chainplates off the boat, Devine went to work removing the starboard side cabinet to see what the back wall looked like (we've never seen that part of Pino).</p>

<p>Devine was looking forward to removing it to repair it, because overtime the screws holding the front and back together got bent, half of them were halfway out of their holes, and the cabinet holding a lot of our food threatened to fall out...</p>

<p>We plan to replace some of the cabinet wood, and to replace many of the screws.</p>

<h2>Rotten Core</h2>

<p>When we bought Pino in 2016, there was two patches of dry rot on the cabin interior, both around the topmost chainplate hole. The chainplate hole on deck wasn't sealed properly, water got in and caused the wood to rot. The dry rot was fixed, we re-bedded the chainplates and they never leaked again... but when we removed the chainplates we saw that the wood core around the hole was exposed and completely wet.</p>

<p>The deck has a marine plywood core. It's a good material, and can resist a lot of humidity, but it can only do so much. It is difficult to understand why the builders didn't seal the wood... exposed wood is a disaster waiting to happen.</p>

<p>We began removing much of the old wet core, using tools we have on hand. It doesn't appear like the wetness got very far, but it's difficult to say. We are not sure yet what we will do to fix it, not knowing is fine because the weather is still too cold to do fibreglass repairs (it was 1C this morning, and we had light snow). We will take time to clean up the area, then we'll make a plan.</p>

<p>More updates soon...</p>
