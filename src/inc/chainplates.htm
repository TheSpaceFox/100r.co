<p>Despite owning Pino for 8 years, there are still parts we've never removed, or seen. This year we plan on cruising in Northern BC and decided to pull the boat's chainplates to see if they needed replacing.</p>

<p>Yamaha 33's (with the engine in the stern), have very long chainplates that go the deck at four points.</p>

<p>Each plate is secured to a cabin bulkhead with two beefy bolts, and then secured to a stainless steel plate that is embedded(fibreglasses) in the hull. The chainplates are sandwiched between two thick slabs, and through-bolted.It's hard to get a good look at what is securing the chainplates to the hull, but we used a mirror to show what it looks like. There is a lot of surface rust, but the metal appeared fine once all of the grime and dust was removed. <img src='../media/content/boat_projects/chainplates_05.jpg' style='float:right;' class='medium' /></p>

<p>To remove the chainplates, we tied a halyard on each side to keep the mast balanced, removed all of the cotter pins, loosened the turnbuckles attached to each chainplate, and removed the backing plate and the sealant where the chainplate enters the hull. Pulling on it by hand wasn't enough to get it out. We tied our whisker pole halyard to the end and winched it out.</p>

<p>The chainplate looks much better after a good clean-up, but unfortunately, this revealed a bit of pit corrosion around one of the upper bolt holes. The chainplate looks good otherwise, with no stress marks, no enlargened bolt holes.</p>

<p>If a length of SS exhibits pit corrosion on the surface, it is an indicator that the corrosion goes deep into the metal.</p>

<p>The chainplates are 8mm thick at the top(outside on deck) and bottom(metal bracket glasses on the hull), and a bit skinnier in the middle (not sure why?).</p>

<p>Stainless Steel is very resistant to corrosion, but can rust when there is no oxygen, a common issue for chainplates that lie tight onto bulkheads, and that are sealed at the deck to prevent water intrusion.</p>

<p>More updates soon...</p>
