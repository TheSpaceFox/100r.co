<p><b>Videos</b>. Between 2016 and 2020, we used a <b>GoPro Session4</b> as well as a <b>Sony a6000</b> to film our travels. The GoPro has the advantage of being <b>light and waterproof</b>â€”making for a perfect everyday-carry camera. Shooting with the SLR required more planning as it could only be used in fair weather. We filmed as much, and as often as we could. At the end of each month, we would watch our footage and write a summary of that month's events. We planned the monthly {videos} ahead, and we would gather footage based on what we needed. While one was busy recording the narration, the other would write music. The two tracks were then edited together (using Blender) with the collected footage. We had our respective tasks when it came time to edit, but both of us took part in the filming.</p>

<p>In rough weather, we prioritized our own safety above all, and so we rarely had footage of rough seas.</p>

<p><b>Wiki</b>. In April 2021, this website was converted into a wiki. This type of website is a kind of archive and mirror of everything that we have done, and that we have learnt. It's a living document that outlines where we've been, and a tool that advises where we could go. You can download a copy of the entire website content and sources as a <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/100r.co/archive/master.zip' target='_blank'>.zip</a>.</p>
