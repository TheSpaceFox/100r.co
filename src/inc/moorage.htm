<p>Living at anchor, that is, in a bay somewhere tethered to the earth with {ground tackle} is free. Living at anchor is the cheap way to go, although getting good {ground tackle} is important as it will keep your boat safe.</p>

<p>Some bays will have moorings installed that you can tie to for a small fee (often around 10-15$.)</p>

<p>Marinas often have guest docks with power, wifi and showers, for a medium-to-high cost (300$-800$.) The longer the boat the bigger the cost. Some marinas charge per dock space rather than boat sizeâ€”beware of these places. Moorage near cities is more expensive, and the price goes up during the high season (summer). Winter moorage is generally much cheaper. If staying at a marina in your home country for long periods, paying for 'liveaboard fees' (up to 150$ extra per month) is necessary. If staying in a marina in a foreign country, liveaboard fees are often waived.</p>

<p>Paying for annual moorage is a good idea, but keeping a boat in a marina means getting liability insurance, which in turn, means you'll need a survey, resulting in a seemingly interminable domino effect which can incur many more costs. Depending the age of your boat, and when it was last surveyed (if ever), you may need a full condition out-of-water survey. This means paying a marina to lift your boat out, and paying the surveyor. A surveyor will point out mandatory items that need fixing and/or replacing, if these items are not complied with within 60 days the insurance will be void.</p>
