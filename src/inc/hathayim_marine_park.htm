<p>We left our beloved {melanie cove} on June 25th, in truth... we could have stayed there forever. It really was an amazing anchorage, but we had to leave because we had to move to Refuge Cove to upload an important video. To upload this video we needed a good strong connection. The connection at other anchorages was fine for sending emails and other kinds of light uploads/downloads, but would never allow us to upload a 40 minute video. The connection there wasn't ideal, it took us 7 hours to upload it, but even this would have been unthinkable in Melanie Cove.</p>

<p>The next day, on June 27th, we left the dock for Hathayim Marine Park (previously Von Donop inlet) on Cortes Island, a 15 nm sail from Refuge Cove. We had planned on going to Squirrel Cove, just a short 2.3 nm sail across the channel, but after reading about sailors fouling their anchors on submerged engine blocks and logging equipement we decided to go elsewhere, so we decided to try and sail to the north of Cortes Island.</p>

<p>The wind was forecast to be 10-15 knots from the NW, right on the nose. To get to the northern end of Cortes, it is necessary to pass through a long narrow channel (Lewis Channel), meaning that we would need to do a lot of tacks to get up there. Pino, with its deep draft and tall mast, sails very well into the wind, and so we decided to work our sailing muscles and to go for it. The wind was at 10-11 knots to start, nice and smooth, and the more we approached the mouth of the channel, the stronger the wind (accelerated through the channel). A sailboat was motoring behind us, and they were kind enough to get out of our way as we made short tacks back and forth.</p>

<p>Sailing this way is rather long, and exhausting, especially in 27 C weather and full sun. In the channel we saw clear-cut areas from logging, places that where never replenished with new trees. New growth on faraway hillsides is easy enough to see, the trees are greener, and draw a clear shape.</p>

<p>We arrived at the north of Cortes, and there the wind decided to stop and we motored the rest of the way. We assumed we would have better wind up there, it is difficult to ever have a guarantee of wind in places dotted with so many islands. The mouth of Hayathim Marine Park was just south of that point, where the entrance narrows and into the narrowest point is a rock, planted dead in the center and making all who pass near it sweat a whole lot. Because the inlet is big, there is a fair amount of current passing through this narrow, strong enough that we let the engine idle to let it carry us through, hugging the right side of the channel with the accursed rock on the port side of Pino. We came in on a rising tide, to make sure there would be plenty of water under our keel.</p>

<p>We found a spot in the southernmost bay, dropping the hook in 25 feet of water. The bottom is mud, and sticky, perfect for weathering anything. It makes a mess when we haul the anchor back up on deck, but at least it makes for a secure anchorage. We both like not having to worry about dragging, although, in truth, the 15 kg Rocna anchor makes it very difficult for the wind to push us around.</p>

<p>We arrived to the sound of a crow yelling, breaking the silence in the bay, and it did not stop yelling for the entire day, and the next day too. We call it a yell rather than a caw, because it sounds like a human trying to sound like a crow. It is very funny, but the kid on the boat next to us did not agree, we heard him yell for it to shut up. Did it shut up? No, it did not.</p>
