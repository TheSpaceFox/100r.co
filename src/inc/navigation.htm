<p>The entire task of navigation rests upon <b>Navionics</b>, installed onto all of our mobile devices. Its depth maps, compass, GPS, waypoints, community edits, and more, are all the features that we could ever wish for to get from A to B, over water. We use it along with a separate AIS tool for traffic. Navionics lists positions in degrees minutes seconds, or DMS for short.</p>
<p>We carry a sextant aboard, and both of us are learning to use it. Depending on GPS isn't ideal, and learning to navigate without it might save your life.</p>
