<p>Our navigation rests upon an old refurbished Standard Horizon chartplotter, and <b>Navionics</b> (installed onto all of our mobile devices). Navionics's depth maps, compass, GPS, waypoints, community edits, and more, are all the features that we could ever wish for to get from A to B, over water. We use it along with a separate AIS tool for traffic. Navionics lists positions in degrees minutes seconds, or DMS for short.</p>
<p>The chartplotter was a donation from our friends on <a href='https://dakotaventures.home.blog/' target=_blank'>SY Dakota</a> (they upgrade d theirs and gave us their old one). For now, it carries all of the maps for {western canada}.</p>
<p>We carry a sextant aboard, and both of us are learning to use it. Depending on GPS isn't ideal, and learning to navigate without it might save your life.</p>
