<p>Safety gear will last you many years if serviced regularly. Pyrotechnic signaling devices (including aerial flares and hand held signals) expire 42 months after the date of manufacture in accordance with the Coast Guard requirements. Typically, this means that you must replace your flares every three boating seasons. Aerial flares cost 75$ per pack of 6 (in Canada), for a boat our size (10m) we need to have 12 aboard. Life jackets and life rafts need to be serviced every 3 years, as the auto-inflating cannisters need testing, and replacing. Replacement cartridges for auto-inflating PFD's cost about 35$ (again, in Canada). If planning to travel for many years out of the country, carry replacement cartridges onboard, because other countries may not carry the ones required by your model and that replacements can't be shipped by air (they're pressurized). Re-packing a liferaft is very expensive, and varies depending on the model, and your location in the world.</p>
