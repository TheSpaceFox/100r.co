<p>Most city-centers will have a hospital, ones out in the islands - south pacific for instance- tend to be good and cheap, but in most cases you must be self-sufficient. That includes a well-stocked medical supply and the know-how to fix yourself up. We carry a general assortment of plasters/band-Aids, non-stick dressings, bandages, adhesive tape, non-latex gloves, alcohol-free moist wipes, scissors, safety pins, tweezers, painkillers, antihistamines, seasickness meds etc</p>
<p> In case of a serious injury, you must have the means to get yourself to the nearest clinic. We use <a href='http://danboater.org' target='_blank' class='external'>DAN Boater</a>, a <b>repatriation insurance</b> that covers helicopter/transportation fees.</p>
<p>We find that <b>medical apps for mobiles, and FM armyfield manuals</b>, are helpful when dealing with minor burns, cuts and various aches.</p>
