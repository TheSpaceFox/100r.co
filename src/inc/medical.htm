<p>Most city-centers will have a hospital. Ones out in the islands—South Pacific for instance—tend to be good and cheap, but in most cases you must be self-sufficient. That includes a well-stocked medical supply, and the know-how to fix yourself up.</p>

<p>Before going {offshore}, if you can, we recommend doing a <b>first-aid course</b>. Knowing what to do in the event of severe bleeding, choking, or severe allergic reactions, could save your crew's life.</p>

<p><b>MALARIA</b></p>

<p>If travelling into Malaria endemic areas, we carry <a href='https://buzzoff.org/product-category/malaria-testing-kits/' target='_blank'>rapid diagnostic tests</a>. The test is 90% accurate and quickly diagnoses if Malaria is present, and if so, which one you have, so that treatment can commence quickly if needed. We only carried tests, because we were close to hospitals, but if traveling to islands with no facilities it is a good idea to also carry antimalarials.</p>

<p><b>JELLYFISH STINGS</b></p>

<p>Stings from marine life can range from painful, to life-threatening.</p>

<p>If stung by a jellyfish:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Flush the injured area with vinegar for at least 30 seconds</b>, if vinegar isn't available mix baking soda and water into a paste and apply it to the area for 20 minutes.</li>
		<li><b>Remove any pieces of the animal</b>, while protecting your hands, </li>
		<li><b>Immerse the affected area</b> in water as hot as the person can tolerate for at least 20 minutes, or until the person feels less pain</li>
	</ul>

<p>Seek medical attention if there is an infection, or if the person has trouble breathing. <b>Always flush with vinegar FIRST</b>, before removing any part of the animal, the tentacles can continue to fire even after they're detached so you must neutralize the poison before touching them or they could inject more poison into the person.</p>

<p><b>HYPOTHERMIA</b>

<p>There are four levels of hypothermia, from mild to severe life-threatening symptoms:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Cold stressed, not hypothermic</b>: conscious, normal movement, shivering, and alert.</li>
	<li><b>Mild hypothermia</b>: conscious, impaired movement, shivering, alert</li>	
	<li><b>Moderate hypothermia</b>: conscious, impaired movement, little or no shivering, not alert</li>
	<li><b>Severe hypothermia</b>: cold, unconscious.</li>
</ul>

</p>Hypothermia happens faster in cold water than cold air. Cold-water immersion has four distinct phases:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Cold-Shock Response:</b> Rapid cooling of the skin causes a gasp followed by hyperventilation (lasting 1 to 2 min).</li>
<li><b>Cold Incapacitation:</b> Further cooling of nerve and muscle fibres causes weakness and a loss of coordination, leading to incapacitation within approximately 15 minutes.</li>
<li><b>Hypothermia:</b> A person dressed appropriately for the weather conditions will take 30 minutes or more to become mildly hypothermic.</li>
<li><b>Circum-Rescue Collapse:</b> Can occur just prior to, during, or after rescue. The signs and symptoms range from collapsing, to fainting, to cardiac arrest. When rescuing a person from cold water, monitor the person’s condition carefully and be prepared to provide emergency care.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are in <b>OPEN WATER</b> and <b>self-rescue is not possible</b>, increase your survival time by doing the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Get out of the water as much as possible</b> by using a capsized boat or other floating object as a flotation device.</li>
	<li>If you are wearing a personal flotation device (PFD), adopt the <b>Heat Escape Lessening Position</b> (HELP):</li>
	<ul>
 		<li>Press your arms against your armpits.</li>
		<li>Place your forearms across your chest.</li>
		<li>Squeeze your thighs together and raise your knees toward your chest.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>If several people are together, adopt the <b>HUDDLE</b> position:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Face each other.</li>
		<li>Have each person squeeze his or her thighs together.</li>
		<li>Form a circle and hug each other. Each person should place one arm above and one arm below the arms of those adjacent, and pull the sides of the chests together.</li>
		<li>Sandwich any children or persons without a PFD inside the HUDDLE.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p><b>Caring for hypothermia</b></p>

<p>Handle the person with hypothermia very gently, and keep their body horizontal. Only move the person if absolutely necessary. Remove wet clothing only if they inside the cabin, sheltered from the cold.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Cold stressed, not hypothermic</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Reduce heat loss, like adding dry clothing.</li>
			<li>Give high-calorie food or drink (warm, sugary, non-alcoholic)</li>
			<li>Increase heat production (exercise, e.g., run in place)</li>
		</ul>
	<li><b>Mild hypothermia</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Handle gently, keep horizontal</li>
			<li>No standing/walking for at least 30 min</li>
			<li>Insulate the person/vapor barrier (hypothermia wrap)</li>
			<li>Give high-calorie food or drink (warm, sugary, non-alcoholic)</li>
			<li>Monitor until improvement for 30 min</li>
		</ul>
	<li><b>Moderate hypothermia</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Handle gently, keep horizontal</li>
			<li>No standing/walking</li>
			<li>Insulate the person/vapor barrier (hypothermia wrap)</li>
			<li>No drink or food</li>
			<li>Apply heat to upper trunk, by applying warm water bottles, or heating pads (i.e., the armpits, chest, and upper back). Body heat from yourself can also work in an emergency</li>
		</ul>
	<li><b>Severe hypothermia</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Treat as moderate hypothermia</li>
			<li>If no obvious vital signs, do 60-second breathing check</li>
			<li>If not breathing, start CPR</li>
		</ul>
</ul>

<p><b>HYPOTHERMIA WRAP</b></p>

<p>Applying a hypothermia wrap, or hypothermia 'burrito', is an excellent way to minimize the heat lost by a person with hypothermia.</p>
<p>It consists of a number of layers of insulation and heat-reflecting material. <b>If help is more than 30 minutes away</b> (common on offshore boats), protect the person from the environment, remove the wet clothing and put them in a hypothermia wrap.</p>

<p>To apply a hypothermia wrap:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Insulation pad</b>. Place it between the person and the ground/floor.</li>
	<li><b>Sleeping bag/blanket</b>. Wrap the person, apply as much insulation as possible.</li>
	<li><b>Hat or hood</b>. Cover person's head/neck with a toque, heavy hat, or hood.</li>
	<li><b>Vapour barrier</b>. If the person is dry, place the vapour barrier outside of the insulation wrap. If the person is wet, place the vapour barrier inside the insulation wrap. If two vapour barriers are available, place one inside and one outside the insulation wrap. A vapour barrier can be a plastic tarp or foil blanket.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>DAN BOATER</b></p>

<p> In case of a serious injury, you must have the means to get yourself to the nearest clinic. We use <a href='http://danboater.org' target='_blank' class='external'>DAN Boater</a>, a <b>repatriation insurance</b> that covers helicopter/transportation fees.</p>

<p><b>MEDICAL RESOURCES</b></p>

<p>We find that <b>medical apps for mobiles, and FM army field manuals</b>, are helpful when dealing with minor burns, cuts and various aches. If you have a smart phone, the <b>Canadian Red Cross app</b> is very good.</p>

<p>We also recommend:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <a href='https://riotmedicine.net/downloads/' target='_blank'>downloadable guides by Riot Medicine</a></li>
		<li><a href='http://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=F4D7E7B3AD83AC012827785EA07DF686' target='_blank'>A Barefoot Doctor’s Manual: The American Translation of the Official Chinese Paramedical Manual</a>(an excellent general health manual)</li>
