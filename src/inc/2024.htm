<p>We spent all of June cruising through Southeast Alaska, we visited 4 cities and stopped by 14 different anchorages. On June 27th, 420 nautical miles later, we arrived in the beautiful town of {Sitka} — our favorite city so far.</p>

<p>We have sailed as far north as we are willing to go this year, at 57°N — the same latitude as Kodiak. Sailing in these waters has been challenging, there is a lot of current, and the wind is often light, or absent. Because of these frequent calms, <a href="../site/engine_care.html">Calcifer II</a> has seen a lot of use this year. We will now slowly make our way back south, exploring new anchorages along the west coast of Southeast Alaska all the while. We continue to update our path in Alaska <a href="../site/us_se_alaska.html">here</a>, when we cross back into Canada we'll resume updates <a href="../site/western_canada.html#2024">here</a>.</p>

<p>We spent this month moving northward through both southern and northern British Columbia. We've been moving almost every day, stopping every night to anchor, sleep and recuperate. Sailing near land is not as relaxing as sailing offshore, this reef-strewn coast requires careful navigation. We've had many long days of endless tacking from one side of the channel to the other, almost all the way to {Port McNeill}, then after that we started to get more weather from the south for some mostly pleasant, but cold and rainy, downwind sailing. We've been using our {woodstove} a lot, in evenings it helps warm the boat after a long sail.</p>

<p>On May 29th, 623 nautical miles miles after leaving {Victoria}, we arrived in {Prince Rupert}, our last major port in British Columbia before we head north to Southeast Alaska. Then, on June 2nd, we arrived in Ketchikan, Southeast Alaska. Most of our updates this month detail some of the places we've been(see the above list). To see our path, look at {western canada} and {us se alaska}. We update the map as we find internet.</p>

<p>We've seen sea otters, lots of humpback whales, two pods of orcas(one pod had a baby tagging along), eagles, and lots of mountains. In other non-travel related news, Devine is going to speak again at <a href="https://handmadecities.com/seattle/" target="_blank">Handmade Seattle</a> this upcoming November!</p>

<p>Pino now has all-new chainplates! We removed the original ones earlier this month to inspect them and found some pit corrosion(as well as a small crack), replacing them was necessary. With the chainplates gone, we removed the entire starboard side cabinet to see what was behind it—it's always nice to see parts of our boat we've never seen. We also replaced 3 old halyards on Pino. Devine earned themself a couple of blisters <a href="../media/content/boat_projects/dyneema_halyard_splice.jpg" target="_blank">splicing dyneema</a> onto some of our existing halyards.</p>

<p>Sejo revisited the <a href="https://compudanzas.net/maintenance_practice.html" target="_blank">Uxn tutorial</a>, and appended corrections. The most important change is that the tutorial is now targeting the <a href="https://metasyn.srht.site/learn-uxn/" target="_blank">learn-uxn platform</a>(online) maintained by <a href="https://metasyn.pw/" target="_blank">metasyn</a>. Now, people can jump right in and experiment without having to set up a dev environment. Tsoding, someone who can code in front of the camera in a language they've never used or read the docs for, did a pretty funny session in Uxntal, you can watch it <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d41KIL4cjQM' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>

<p>There has been too many exciting Uxn projects coming out these past few days, so we'll just put <a href='https://merveilles.town/tags/uxn' target='_blank'>a link to the hashtag</a>. Someone also created a <a href='https://discord.gg/QKapkAxsg9' target='_blank'>Discord channel</a>, it's a good place to learn about other concatenative languages and an alternative for people who have trouble with #uxn, in irc.libera.chat.</p>

<p>Late last month we started re-modeling part of our galley, the work is now complete! It's subtle, but the splash image for the log now includes the re-design. We will test our new galley when we go out cruising.</p>

<p>Pino will be adventuring a bit more north this summer, we're planning to explore the north coast of British Columbia, all the way to Prince Rupert, or possibly Ketchikan(AK), areas with little to no cell coverage. How far we go depends on what we find on the way. If the seas and winds are kind, and if we have time, we might go farther. We spend our days studying charts, gathering supplies, and fixing up the boat to make sure the passage is safe and pleasant. More updates on our plans soon!</p>

<p>On January 10th the forge that we use to host our projects was taken down by DDoS attacks and was struggling to come back online(it's back now, read the <a href="https://sourcehut.org/blog/2024-01-19-outage-post-mortem/" target="_blank">post-mortem</a>), the event reminded us that we ought to host mirrors and release versions of these source files ourselves. We have begun to <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/etc/" target="_blank">host copies</a> across our various websites. The builds are still accessible through <a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/" target="_blank">itch.io</a>. These will be automatically updated as we work on them in their individual repositories, but mirrored there for reliability. We are thankful for Sourcehut's tireless work on resolving the issue and for taking the time to communicate important changes.</p>

<p>In keeping with the spirit of improving the resilience of the tools we use we've taken a moment to write a kind of pocket version of the console emulator and <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/drifblim.html" target="_blank">self-hosted assembler</a> as to see how many lines are needed to start from the seed assembler and replicate it. A copy of the pocket emulator, the source for the assembler and its hexadecimal representation have been <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html" target="_blank">documented</a>.</p>

<p>On January 17th {Victoria} got its first <a href="../media/content/stream/2024_snow.jpg">snowfall</a>, with it came temperatures below freezing. We got to test our recent improvements, like a new <a href="../media/content/boat_projects/vent.jpg">louvered closet vent</a> to help ventilate the space(there are also two existing vents at the top, one on each side). The closet has been dry for the first time in 3 years. We've made an effort not to keep too many items on the floor so the area can breathe. We got ice inside of the windows for the first time ever though... not ideal.</p>
