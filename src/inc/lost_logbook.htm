<h2 id='transcript'>Lost logbook transcripts</h2>

<p>Sometimes when sailing I would write down what was happening, but I did not do it consistently, the results are a incomplete notes scattered across multiple notebooks. I re-read some of the notes recently, and thought it might be fun to publish it online, like what we did for the {north pacific logbook}. Although, as I said, the notes are incomplete.</p>

<p>I added commentary to some of the writing to help explain why we did what we did, this is especially useful for our failed attempt at sailing to Hawaii in 2016.</p>

<h2>Sailing to Hawaii attempt</h2>

<p><b>Context</b>: When we bought Pino in January 2016, we already knew that we wanted to take it offshore. We wanted to go to Japan. As you know, we made it there in 2019 after a long detour in the South Pacific, but we had planned on going via Hawaii in the summer of 2016.</p>

<p>We had never sailed offshore, and we thought it safer to invite a third crew member aboard. We invited a friend who had some sailing experience. The three of us had never done a night shift, or sailed more than 30 nautical miles consecutively. We spent the summer preparing the boat for the trip. In early July, we stopped in Cadboro Bay and left late that same evening for our trip to Hawaii.</p>

<p><b>Evening of July 6th</b></p>    
<p>First overnight sail, with 20-30 knots of wind. We are close-reaching. Had 2 hour-long night shifts. Because of the dark, we had trouble telling the lights onshore apart from those of passing cargo ships. Devine undid two reefs by themself in the dark while on watch.</p>

<p>We are arriving to the mouth of the Strait of Juan de Fuca soon. We can see Cape Flattery ahead. The seas are calm, with long, low swells. There is some wind, an improvement from the 0-5 knots we had earlier. I am listening to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy audio book. The skies are clear, our solar is performing well. Last night's sail was cold and wet. We wore our foul weather gear, with an army blanket laying over our legs to keep warm. I wonder if there will be wind outside of the Strait. The forecast calls for no wind, but we shall see...</p>

<p><i><b>Comments:</b> Sailing at night is inevitable when doing long passages, but reefing alone in the dark is not recommended, especially if there are crew around that can help.</i></p>

 <p><b>July 7th</b></p>
 <p>No wind at the mouth of the Strait, as predicted. We are stuck in thick fog near Cape Flattery. The scene is nightmarish. We are sitting in the dark and cold, with little to no visibility. Birds or bats are circling the boat, making high-pitched noises. We could also hear whales surfacing near the boat. We're worried that they'll get too close to Pino.</p>

<p>I saw a boat in the distance, its light cutting through the fog. Like the whales, we hoped that it too would stay away.</p>

<p>The wind returned at around 0400. We are pointing west, forced to go further offshore. We can't point south because of the strength of the wind. The waves rose with the wind, which ranged from 25-30 knots. Someone had to constantly occupy the helm to surf up and down the huge swells. The rain poured heavily then too. No matter what we tried, we could not progress southward in any way. We are worried, because the waves are getting bigger, and because we don't want to go too far west.</p>

<p>The three of us are exhausted, we can't eat or sleep. Cooking on the stove in this weather is impossible. We have made the decision to go back to the entrance to the Strait, no easy task. We noticed the boom halyard was loose, but no one wanted to go up on deck to fix it.</p>

<p>A humpback whale surfaced just a few feet from Pino's side. I screamed, because of how dangerously close it was but also because I'd never seen a humpback whale before. We battled the waves all night to return to the Strait. We couldn't see the land with our eyes either because of the thick fog.</p>

<p>We arrived in Port Renfrew just before dark, and dropped anchor in the bay. The 3 of us were terribly sleep deprived, and physically exhausted. We came to the conclusion that sailing offshore was masochistic. We, creatures of comfort, don't belong here.</p>

<p><i><b>Comments:</b> On that first eerie night becalmed on the ocean, no one slept. We were all too afraid to be on watch alone outside in the fog. Someone had to accompany the one on watch outside, which defeated the entire purpose of night watches. The result was that two people were tired at the same time. We were right to be afraid, it was a very scary moment with some very real threats (whales nearby surfacing, cargo ship traffic etc) and no one aboard had ever sailed at night before. There were too many new things happening at once, things that we weren't sure how to handle. The creatures circling the boat were birds, storm petrels. We encountered these birds many more times, only ever at night, but it stopped being a scary experience. Sailing at night became a time of leisure, a time to think.<br>
For some reason we did not see these strong southerlies coming. I blame the fact that we had not yet mastered the use of the Iridium GO, and it is possible that we got the forecast for the wrong day. If we had seen that weather we would not have gone.<br>
We were exhausted because no one had slept on that first night, because of the cold, rain and fog. Everything seems worse than it is when you are sleep deprived. It is harder to make good decisions, but I am glad that we decided to go back. This wasn't a good way to start this trip.</i></p>

<p><b>July 8th</b></p>

<p>We started to motor eastward. We motored for a few hours through fog, with the aim to go to Sooke, but halfway there, we decided to stop in Clallam Bay to fuel up and to maybe give this trip another good try. The weather was wet and cold still. We realized during the transit that all this time we could have used a piece of Sunbrella to close the gap between the dodger and bimini to keep the rain off our heads. Up until that point, we hadn't realized that this was what this bit of fabric was for.</p>

<p>We tried to make a makeshift rain catcher for fun and to pass the time. We arrived at Olson's Resort to find that all the boats moored there were fishing boats. We couldn't see the fuel dock anywhere, and they wouldn't answer our hails on the VHF. And so, we went to dock wherever there was room and Devine went for a walk ashore to find it. Devine found the harbormaster and the location of the fuel dock, he also assured us that the depth there could accommodate Pino's deep draft. As we neared the dock, the number on the depth sounder kept going down, and down until it read zero and we touched bottom. We spun around in place for a second, before backing up and docking back to where we were before with plans to fill and ferry the Jerry cans by hand instead. One of the workers at the station offered to drive us back to the docks in his golf cart. We squeezed into the tiny space with the driver and our Jerry cans. Everyone took noticed of us, the only boat larger than 20 feet, and certainly the only one with a mast.</p>

<p>We went to a small cafe nearby for lunch. We tried to download GRIB files again to see the weather, but no luck. The cafe was full of fishermen and harbour workers drinking beer and exchanging stories. We wandered over to the marina office afterwards to find some WiFi. We finally got hold of the GRIB files, and saw just how strange the weather was out there. A big system covered the whole West coast, and the red sausage was still there. We packed up our things and headed over to Neah Bay to wait out the weather.</p>

<p>When in Neah Bay, no one seemed to agree on what to do next. Devine suggested we try and go to California, and to leap from there but I was worried about being near shore. Our friend was hesitant about the entire trip, and I didn't know how to feel. All I wanted was a good plan.</p>

<p><i><b>Comment:</b></i> Clallam bay is on the American side of the strait, as is Neah Bay. We were not checked into the USA at this point and we should not have stopped to either of these places. They could have fined us, or worse. Don't do this.<br>When I say 'red sausage', I am referring to the GRIB file visualizations that show bad weather has a red spot. The area of bad weather on the West coast was probably long, and narrow like a sausage.<br>When Devine suggested trying to go down the coast (complete later)</p>

<p><b>July 10th</b></p>

<p>We got up early and set out to sea. It was a beautiful sunny day. Devine & I are in a good mood. We discussed trying to go offshore again, but our friend expressed some concerns. They were worried about going out there again, worried that we'd hit another patch of bad weather. We understood their feelings perfectly, but were also saddened by them. We could only go offshore if all of us agreed, and because we didn't get turned back, yet again. We headed back to Neah Bay, feeling real low, and just then we spotted Rick and Chris aboard Amiswki heading out to see, sailing past us. Devine was terribly embarrassed, and visibly sad. Rick called us on VHF and we explained what was happening. We watched them sail away with heavy, heavy hearts. What we had planned for for months wasn't going to happen. We tried to keep our displeasure to ourselves, but it wasn't easy. Our friend had every right to feel uncertain about this voyage. It's a trip with a lot of uncertainties, and we don't have all the answers. As I am writing this, we are motoring back to Neah Bay. The wind is with us, but we don't want to sail. Today is going to be a tough day. Devine & I will attempt a trip south ourselves later this year, maybe. We don't want to endanger anyone else, nor do we want to make them feel bad. It's true, there are a lot of things we're not comfortable with right now and that coming onboard with us may be scary due to our lack of experience. We are crazy determined. This isn't the end.</p>

<p>We are waiting in Neah Bay, for I don't know what. The wind is howling. There's supposed to be 15-25 knots of wind out there. At anchor, the boat is rocking and rolling. I don't know what to do with myself. I feel sad, and discouraged. We had 2 false starts in 3 days, it's too much. Devine wants to try and leave next week but I don't know what I want right now. Jimmy Cornell's book on world sailing routes doesn't recommend this route in late July to August. I am not sure what to think. We don't have phone service, or internet. I just want to sleep the day away.</p>

<p><b>July 11th</b></p>

<p>I feel very shitty today. We woke up in Neah Bay, engulfed in fog. The sky was grey, as was everything else. Cold, grey and depressing. We motored out of Neah Bay. We're sitting at the edge of the continent, with the open sea just ahead and we are going the opposite direction, back towards the inside of the strait. No one wants to sit outside today, so we are navigating from the cabin with Navionics and the radar. I am lying down, wrapped in a sleeping bag. We have covered 20 nm and have another 20 to go. We're planning on anchoring in Sooke Inlet. I don't really want to go there, but I also don't want to motor anymore. Devine is thinking of dropping off our friend in Victoria, where we can re-supply and try for Hawaii again. It's late in July, I don't know what I want to do, or what is smart to do. I think I want to go offshore, but the weather worries me. I don't know if leaving just the two us is a good idea, either. If we don't go I'm not certain what we will do.</p>

<p>I am feeling very lethargic. I'm sick of motoring, sick of the cold and wet weather. We've covered a lot of ground in the last few days, but towards nowhere that is of interest to me. In my mind we have failed, it's too late. The boat is a sad place, it is full of food and wine and I have no stomach for any it. I feel as though I don't deserve it.</p>

<p>I've been feeling very bitter and angry for most of the day, but I am better now. I have updated our status on Twitter, our parents were worried. I feel bad about that. The SAT phone isn't as reliable as we thought it was. We're heading towards Becher Bay. I don't know what to do, but at least I know I am not ready for another run down the Strait.</p>

<p>--break--</p>

<p>At this point of the log, there is a break until August 11th. During that time, we went to the Victoria Inner Harbour and dropped off our friend. They left and flew back home. Devine & I sailed around in the Gulf Islands, and while in North Saanich we met Kim and Claudia, an American couple. We spent the evening aboard their boat Essencia, listening to stories about life in Alaska on both land and sea. We got along so well that we decided to accompany them to False Creek in Vancouver. While there we discussed future plans and they shared their intention of sailing south to Mexico this year in early August. At this point, our boat was still full of food from our last false start and we were still eager to go offshore, and so we made the decision to buddy-boat down south together.</p>
<p>Sometimes we wonder if we would have left Canada if we hadn't met them. At this point we had not considered Mexico at all, and became very excited about the idea.</p>

<p><b>August 11th</b></p>

<p>We left the inner harbour at 0800 for Port Angeles to check in with customs. There is no wind in the Juan De Fuca Strait, and the seas are flat calm. We encountered a cruise ship on the way out of the harbour at Ogden Point, it was blocking the way, waiting to pull into port.</p>

<p>We crossed 5 other ships on the way to Port Angeles. The weather is beautiful, there's not a cloud in sight. Because of the weak winds, it is going to a long day on the water.</p>

<p>We had to motor the whole way, due to lack of wind. We checked in with US customs and went to anchor outside of the boat haven. Later, we left anchor and joined Kim and Claudia on the transient dock to talk about our schedule and route to San Francisco. After our discussion, we wanted to return to anchor but our Iridium SAT phone was giving us a hard time. We needed internet to fix our problem (issue with coordinates). We ended up staying on the dock overnight because we finished late, and were too brain dead to move.</p>

<p><b>August 12th</b></p>

<p>We woke up at 0630 to a calm Friday morning. We had breakfast underway (banana oatmeal and peanut butter toast). The strait was becalmed, and so we motored. We finally got some wind later on, and tried to fly our Gennaker to catch every puff of wind. We progressed rapidly, but eventually lost the wind again. Essencia caught up to us, and motored past. We too turned on the iron wind then. Too much motoring, we thought. We made the decision to fuel up at Neah Bay (either today if we don't get there too late, or early tomorrow morning). We don't like to motor, but the lack of wind was driving me mad.</p>

<p>We had the last of the kimchi on rice with tofu, kale, carrots, and a pirate cookie for desert. Devine finished reading AI vs Zombies, a book they'd been reading for a while now. I managed to make 2 holes in my new shirt already (sigh).</p>

<p>When we arrived in Neah Bay we rafted with Essencia and had some champagne to celebrate our imminent "big left turn". We had spaghetti for dinner, and I made some beer bread and ume onigiri for tomorrow. We went to bed early, and read passages from The Curve of Time by Wylie Blanchett. Chris Read gave us this book as a going away present. It is funny to read about boating in British Columbia, about places we've never been to, when we're just a day away from leaving it all behind.</p>

<p><b>August 13th</b></p>

<p>We left early and went to the fuel dock for one last time (we hope). We made the decision to sail to Newport, Oregon instead of going straight to San Francisco to wait out some bad weather in the Cape Mendocino area. We motored out of the strait, and finally were able to cut the engine and to sail south as the wind began to fill our sails. We sailed alongside Essencia for a while, but as the fog rolled in their boat disappeared. We could see their position on radar, and to check if there was other traffic in the area.</p>

<p>We had onigiri and wasabi soy sauce for lunch. The sun did not show itself again. The world is cloudy and grey, a frame out of Silent Hill. We are zooming southward with a reefed main at a good 6 knots. We had 20 knots at our backs, out of the northwest. The waves are strong and erratic, making Pino lurch. We're glad to have taken some scopolamine patches.</p>

<p>We had some re-hydrated minestrone soup with beer bread for dinner. Cutting vegetables was out of the question. The movement of the boat makes it impossible to cut anything inside. We are keeping in contact with Essencia, but we lost all visual contact.</p>

<p>We just passed Forks. We had some mint chocolate and now we're listening to Radiolab podcasts. We'd really like to get AIS for Pino, so we can see ships coming. For now, we look outside every 15 minutes, or we turn on the radar. We're not using the radar often, because it is cloudy and it requires too much power.</p>

<p>We went 40 nm offshore to avoid traffic near the coast. We had trouble with the auto-pilot, it kept overturning and turning us into the wind. Each time we would have to go outside to reset it. It happened four times on my watch. During my shift, I had trouble discerning buoys from ships. I had an onigiri and kept watch from 0200 to 0430.</p>

<p><i>We ended up getting AIS in New Zealand for our trip to Japan. Having it earlier would have been useful for this part of the coast. There is a lot of traffic, from fishing boats and cargo ships. In fog, we relied on radar a lot, but AIS makes it possible to identify ships and their heading and to divert to avoid collisions.</i></p>

<p><b>August 14th</b></p>

<p>The air is warmer today, spied some bits of blue sky and sun but neither stayed long. We still can't communicate with Essencia. It's either we can't hear them, or they can't hear us. Last time we spoke they told us they were at the mouth of the Columbia River. We were at that same latitude, but 40 nautical miles away. We decided to alter our course to try and get closer to them.</p>

<p>I prepared banana oatmeal for breakfast, but I spilled it on the counter top because of an auto-pilot malfunction. I had to leave the bowl unattended to fix the problem, and when I returned I found a puddle of food where my bowl used to be. Devine had peanut butter on a toasted slice of beer bread. The seas are too wild for making coffee.</p>

<p>For lunch we shared a plate of dhal over rice, and had mint chocolate for dessert. We had some trouble with the jib after it got itself stuck into a horrible hourglass shape. It took some effort to free it. Devine also fixed the auto-pilot by putting a rope to keep the little arm down so it stops jumping off. It seems like a good temporary fix so far. We used it all afternoon. Even after this fix, I steered all morning, I do a better job surfing down waves. We both napped today, and I did a bit of Spanish on Duolingo. I can't seem to remember articles and verb tenses well.</p>

<p>During one of my watches I saw a white patch close to the surface of the water. I thought it was a giant jellyfish but it turned out to be a sunfish! I'd never seen one before.</p>

<p>For dinner we had chickpeas sauteed in garlic and sesame oil with a peanut butter sriracha sauce. We later caught up with Essencia on the radio, and found out they were 10 nautical miles away from our position. We are now relaxing inside, escaping the drizzly weather outside. We're going to arrive in Newport at around 8 am. We had to get there on a flood, or during slack tide, anytime from 0500 to 1200. We plan to wait there for the weather around Mendocino to calm down.</p>

<p><i>Our autopilot had many problems, and the reason it did was because we weren't balancing the sails right. Relying entirely on a powered autopilot to correct the course is a bad idea, it is too demanding. Our autopilot was old, but we also abused the hell out of it. The little arm coming off was a problem, but later we found that the belt was worn. We bought a new belt in San Francisco, but then the motor died on the way to French Polynesia. We ripped it out while at sea. When the autohelm died it made the wheel very hard to turn, we had to tear it out very quickly. While Devine removed wheel to remove all of the autohelm components, I was steering with the emergency tiller.</i></p>

<p><b>August 15th</b></p>

<p>Devine & I tried a new way of doing watches at night. Both of us slept 30 minutes at a time with alarms, taking turns. The person whose alarm rings goes to look outside and at the radar for traffic, then the person goes to bed. After 15 minutes the other person's alarm rings, and they go to check. We did this all night, I wasn't too tired and felt fine afterwards. I had banana oatmeal for breakfast, and Devine had a fig bar and a banana. I tried to make coffee but I wasted a batch after a big swell hit us hard on the side. We're going to be in port at noon, if everything goes well. I am worried about entering Yaquina Bay because of the thick fog, and because we have to cross a bar to get there.</p>

<p><i>Doing 30 minute shifts is very... silly. It is not enough time to rest. We were trying things at this point, see what worked and what didn't. We only did this for one night. We later settled into 3 hours on, and 3 hours off at night for watches, and kept this schedule for our entire circumnavigation of the Pacific. It worked well for us, but we've met other sailors that prefer longer shifts, up to 5-6 hours at a time.</i></p>

<p><b>August 16th</b></p>

<p>The fog dissipated when we neared Yaquina Bay. We saw Essencia bob out of the fog too, just a short distance behind us. I was glad to have arrived before they did, it seems like they're always getting past us—not this time! We crossed the bar at 1030 without any problems, and went to dock at the Southbeach Marina.</p>

<p>Newport is a fun city. After arriving, we joined Kim and Claudia at Rogue Brewery for drinks. We had a sampler and some food. After our meal, we went for a walk downtown. Newport was full of tourists and Steller sea lions. We enjoyed seeing tourists eating in restaurants by the water, to the sound of a pile of sea lions burping and yelling at each other. We tried to find a marine store to purchase AIS, but found nothing.</p>

<p><b>August 17th</b></p>

<p>Other boats arrived on the docks, namely Morgan and Douglas on Tumbleweed, a Valiant 42. Devine & I went out to try and find a cafe to work from. We found a natural food place that served coffee with plenty of seating. We worked on our projects for a while and then joined Essencia Tumbleweed for drinks. I had a whisky sampler which I loved, and another drink (name escapes me) that had a back taste of vomit.</p>

<p><i>Morgan and Douglas had plans to take Tumbleweed to Japan. We couldn't believe. We sailed together to many countries after this. We weren't ever leaving on the same dates, or taking the exact same routes (in the cook islands they went to the northern island, we went south, in New Zealand they went to Opua, we, to Whangarei etc), but we would always find each other at one point or another. They became very good friends, and we still talk today.</i></p>

<p><b>August 18th</b></p>

<p>Devine & I spent the morning trying to make a recording for our first video capsule about our travel map and how we make updates using our Iridium GO!</p>

<p>We noticed a lot of boats leaving this morning. We went to Oceana (the cafe) to upload our finished video and to check the weather online. We saw that people had left today because of good winds out of the north. It made me doubt our decision to stay here an extra day.</p>

<p><i>When other sailboats start leaving an anchorage in droves, it is easy to panic and to wonder if there is something going on that we don't know. It is better not to follow others out, unless you have all the information, especially when it comes to offshore passages. Do your research, trust your planning.</i></p>

<p><b>August 20th</b></p>

<p>We left Newport Oregon at 0130, through fog and darkness and closely followed by some fishing boats. Their lights were blinding. We had to motor because we had the wind on the nose. Annoyed, we tried to tack closer to shore to get some speed, but as we neared land we entered a big fog bank and found it full of fishing vessels. We thought it safer to tack back out. We spent the day tacking, and tested our 30 minutes on and off watches.</p>

<p><b>August 22nd</b></p>

<p>We passed the state of Oregon and have arrived in California! Unfortunately, we didn't do it by sail. The seas are flat, and as calm as ever. We filled our fuel tank again this morning, with half a Jerry can to spare. We're thinking of stopping in Fort Bragg to refuel. The water was so tame that we were able to make lattes—so fancy! That night, we slept in shifts of 3 hours on, 3 off. So far, the GRIB files aren't all that helpful. We are slowly motoring to our next and most worrisome checkpoint: Cape Mendocino. We still have 59.5 nautical miles to go before we get there. We looked at the GRIB files a little while later and noticed there was more wind offshore, and so we changed our heading with the goal of going 40 nautical miles away from the coast instead of 30.</p>

<p>Where is that 10-15 knots I was promised? I am sick of hearing the engine running, and of seeing our limp sails. I promised Devine a glass of wine and some dark chocolate once we pass Cape Mendocino.</p>

<p>--End of US West Coast transcript--</p>

<p>Our encounter with Cape Mendocino turned out to be very uneventful, rather boring (and that is fine). The wind was down and we motored past it. We had to motor too often, maybe because we were reading the weather wrong. It is difficult to remember now. I documented the rest of our travels on the {us west coast} page. On this transit, we timed our passages rather badly. </p>

<h2>Mexico</h2>

<p>Turtle Bay to San Jose Del Cabo</p>

<p>Coming out of Turtle Bay we hailed Tumbleweed on the radio. They walked out of their boat in their pyjamas and waved us off. The wind was weak in the bay, but got stronger as we moved on. We sailed on quietly, with the land gradually fading away. We went our furthest offshore, at 60-70 nautical miles. We eventually met up with land again, as it curved back towards us.</p>

<p>I forgot what I'd read about Cabo San Lazaro, but like all capes the wind accelerates and things can get messy. On one of my night shifts I could see the wind was rising, higher and higher. We had a full main and jib out. I'd read a passage in Lin Pardey's book "The Self-Sufficient Sailor" saying that you should be able to reef alone, and I was determined to try but the wind was already too strong. I should have reefed the moment I saw the wind speed increase. I tried to head into the wind to reef but the autopilot didn't like it. I called to Devine to come out and help me reef. Just then, the wind caught into the jib as I was trying to furl it and caused the top of the sail to balloon out, with the lower half rolled up. The bit of sail that had ballooned was making a racket and was shaking the entire rig. To undo it we had to make a few turns. Eventually, we freed it and secured it properly before putting in a reef into the main.</p>

<p>We were worried that we had damaged the headsail, but it appeared to be fine. We took part of the main down to the first reef. Devine put the ring in the bullhorn and tightened the reef line down. Though, for some reason, the main had a strange shape. It had this... weird fold. We aimed a light at the top and saw what was wrong. A whole panel appeared to be missing. We decided to keep it up. The wind wasn't too strong now and it would be morning soon... we would deal with this problem then. It didn't look like it was going to rip further.</p> 

<p>On the next day, at first light, we got a good look at our damaged main. The panel wasn't missing, the stitching had come undone and the elastics on the outer edges of the sail were the only thing holding the bottom and top panels together. Although, the elastics were stretched, and the part that was still inside the sail was all compressed, creating strange folds. We took the sail down, discouraged at the state of the sail that had served us so well this past year.</p>

<h2>Sailing from Vava'u Tonga to Whangarei in New Zealand</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, I did not write logs for any of the passages between Mexico and {Tonga}. After Mexico, we hopped over to {French Polynesia}, then over to the {Cook Islands}, and {Niue}. I did document our time there in the form of blogs posts, see {internet in paradise}, {rainy with a chance of mosquitoes}, and {the rock of polynesia}. We spent a few months sailing in Tonga in late 2017, and checked out of the country on October 20th. The text below talks about the checking out process, and covers part of the sail south to New Zealand.</p>

<p><b>October 20th</b></p>

<p>We left our mooring early and went to dock at the wharf to check out of Tonga. Devine was worried about using the commercial dock because of the big black bumpers lining the sides. We decided to go the concrete pier instead, although there wasn't much room and the southerlies would make it difficult to push off afterwards. We went to dock there anyway, aiming for a spot behind a whale watching boat. When we got near we noticed that the area was too shallow, and we had to back off. We went to dock in front of the boat instead and the captain, who was aboard at the time, came to give us a hand.</p>

<p>When we checked into Tonga a local was standing on this same pier, asking if we could give him some ropes. His timing wasn't ideal, he asked us this as we were docking, as I was struggling to reign Pino in. We had no ropes to spare. This same person was there today, trying to get us to buy one of his homemade Tongan flags. We thought it funny since we were about to check out and would no longer need a Tongan flag.</p>

<p>We're glad we decided not to go on the commercial dock because a cruise ship arrived, and we would have had to move.</p>

<p>Devine went to check us out with customs, but the officer on duty was hung over and forgot to stamp our passports. I am glad I checked the passports before we left the dock. We had to go back to get them stamped. Leaving without this mark in our passports would have been very bad, especially since our next port is New Zealand and that they would have checked for it.</p>

<p>We tried to push off the dock, but as expected the wind was heaving us back onto it. The captain of the whale watching boat was there to assist us again. We're glad he was there, otherwise we might have struck the old rust bucket of a boat docked ahead of us. Once we were free of that accursed wharf, we sailed over to Port Maurelle. Once there, we got Pino ready for tomorrow. We planned to leave at first light. We dove under the boat and scrubbed the bottom to make sure we were in accordance with New Zealand's bio-fouling laws. A boat with a dirty bottom might be refused entry, and would be forced to haul out for a clean-up. The water was cold today, but at least I got to spend some time with the parrot fish swimming under our boat.</p>

<p>Josh came to see us. He planned to take the same weather window as us, but he was going to leave tonight. Washing the boat made us both tired, and we went to bed early.</p>

<p><b>October 21-22 2017</b></p>

<p>We woke up early at 0600, we saw that Josh was gone already. We motored out of Port Maurelle, waving goodbye to our neighbours in the bay. We cut the engine after passing the point at Swallows Cave, and slowly began to sail out of Tongan waters. Our progress was slow at first because of the tall mass of land blocking the wind. We crawled past Hunga Haven, and then started to get some ocean swells. From that point on, sailing slow became a thing of the past.</p>

<p>With the land gone, the wind and waves hit us hard. We sailed close-hauled, into the wind with two reefs in the mainsail and a full jib. We'd never sailed so well into the wind before, we were amazed. The wind was coming out of the southeast, blowing at 15-25 knots and gusting to 30. Pino's body slammed into the waves, the saltwater spray on deck was never ending. Sailing into the wind is always uncomfortable, but this point of sail requires no adjustments what-so-ever, and permits us to lock the wheel and take shelter under the dodger.</p>

<p>Even if Pino did not need our help, I went to steer. Whenever I feel sea sick steering helps me get better. My eyes and inner ear adjust, my body understands the movement of the boat and all is well and good.</p>

<p>We sailed around underwater volcanoes and shoals. We had read that some sailors encounter pumice afloat on the water, we hoped not to encounter any. The pumice can slow you down and abrade the hull. In these waters, islands come in and out of existence as volcanoes erupt. We pushed further west when the wind increased. This wind was with us for a whole two days. We had a can of ratatouille on the first day. Cooking was too hard, as was eating but we made good time. We sailed past the Ha'apais, and Tongatapu in two days. The sun returned later, and when it came we dried out our wet clothes and damp bodies. There were salt crystals everywhere on deck, covering our foulies and any bit of exposed skin.</p>

<p><b>October 23rd 2017</b></p>

<p>We kept contact with Douglas and Morgan on Tumbleweed. They were still in Vava'u. We exchanged thoughts on our planned route and on the coming weather.</p>

<p>The wind calmed eventually, as did the waves. For a while the wind seemed to blow from a new direction every hour, it was very frustrating, but it then settled into the southwest. Winds out of that direction made difficult to make any heading at all. We sailed westward, but didn't like how fast west we were going.</p>

<p>I stopped feeling sea sick. Funny how dark the world feels when sea sick. During such times I say that I hate sailing and question all of our decisions, then it passes, and sailing becomes awesome again.</p>

<p><b>October 24th 2017</b></p>

<p>The sun appeared again. We dried our clothes and enjoyed the last bit of warmth we would get from South Pacific waters. Sailing south, heading into New Zealand spring means it will get much colder.</p>

<p><b>October 25th 2017</b></p>

<p>The wind turned and began to blow out of the east. Having the wind on the beam makes it difficult to self-steer, and so we alternated driving. 3 hours on, 3 hours off during the day. I continued to listen to The Vampire Lestat audio book at night, especially during my 0000 to 0300 shift. I can only listen to it for the first two hours, I am always tired on the third hour and have to listen to upbeat music to keep awake. It is not rare for me to dance in the cockpit at 0200. Devine listens to Tim Ferris at night these days, we have a lot of discussions about it during our coffee hour the next morning.</p>

<p>We saw porpoises by the boat this morning, it was nice. But we discovered many leaks in the boat, not so nice. The hatch over the saloon isn't watertight. Last night a wave washed over the bow and slid up over the roof and over the hatch, saltwater came to splash onto me as I slept in my bunk. I was pissed, and tired. Half-awake, I took a cushion and wedged it into the hole where the hatch was. It filled the hole up nicely, and then I Ducktaped the cushion onto the ceiling. Problem solved. We both had a laugh come morning, seeing the waterlogged cushion secured over our heads.</p>

<p><i><b>Comments:</b>I wish I'd written more, but I remember what happened after that very clearly. The wind stayed in the east for the rest of the passage, and we did not experience any severe weather. For a while, we thought something might be brewing near Australia, but it never manifested. Two days away from arriving in New Zealand, we met Josh on Maestral mid-ocean. We passed by him, closely, and we took pictures of each other's boats! He was slowing down to time his arrival in Opua during daytime. His engine was messed up so he wanted to be able to see all obstacles to sail onto the dock on arrival. We sailed past him, and arrived to check in at Marsden Cove in Whangarei at night.</i></p>

<p>This was a very fast passage, we sailed 1,200 nautical miles in 9 days. To read more about our time in {New Zealand}, read our blog posts {an island to oneself}.</p>
