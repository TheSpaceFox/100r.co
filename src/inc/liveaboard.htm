<p>When it comes to cleaning, polishing or abrading, you don't need a crazy arsenal of products. Below is a list of recommendations for household cleaning, or maintenance aboard a boat.</p>
<table class='col' border='1'>
    <tr>
        <td><b>All purpose cleaner</b></td>
        <td>Mix of 500 ml hydrogen peroxide(3%) with 2.5 ml(40 drops) of lavender and lemon essential oils, and 0.6 ml(10 drops) of peppermint essential oil. Leave on surface for several minutes before wiping clean. Store in a dark-coloured bottle.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Chrome</b></td>
        <td>Apply apple cider vinegar on a soft cotton cloth to rub it clean. Then, use a fresh cloth with a dab of baby oil to make it shine.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Copper</b></td>
        <td>Make a paste of either lemon or lime juice and salt. Rub gently to clean.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Aluminum</b></td>
        <td>Cream of tartar and hot water. In a dish, add a few spoonfuls of cream of tartar, and stir in water to create a thick paste. Rub over the aluminum surface with a soft cloth.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Acrylic</b></td>
        <td>Use a mild dish soap. Mix about 1 L of water with a few drops of dish soap in a bowl, agitate to create suds. Dip cloth into mix, clean acrylic gently. Wipe with a clean, damp rag, and follow up with a soft, dry rag to collect leftover moisture.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Plastic</b></td>
        <td>Use a mixture of 1:2 white vinegar and warm water.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Brass</b></td>
        <td>Coat the cut half of the lemon with table salt and rub it over the surface, re-coating the lemon with salt as needed. Buff to a shine with a clean, dry cloth.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Cast iron</b></td>
        <td>Immediately after use, clean with plain hot water and a sponge. Stuck on food can be removed with a paste made of coarse salt and water. Dry with a towel, or over the oven at a low flame, and coat with a layer of oil.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Stainless steel</b></td>
        <td>Wipe down with freshwater, or use a mild soap solution and warm water for tough stains.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Fibreglass</b></td>
        <td>Dislodge debris with a scrubbing brush, rinse off with fresh water. For rust stains, make a paste of baking soda and water. Use a soft cloth and gently rub mixture onto the stain. Leave for 1 hour. For heavy yellow waterline and rust stains try Grunt emer-gel, a phosphoric acid-based product. Wear gloves while using it, as it is an irritant.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Wood dishes</b></td>
        <td>Wash with mild soap and warm water. Dry immediately after washing. Never soak in water or put it away wet. Every month, apply a coat of food-grade oil (we use coconut) to keep the wood moisturized.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Wood cutting boards</b></td>
        <td>Same basic treatment as wood dishes. Before adding oil, scrub clean with lemon and salt. Sprinkle board with coarse salt. Using a lemon half, cut side down, scour the surface. Let sit for 5 minutes, scrape mixture away, rinse clean and let air dry.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Sails</b></td>
        <td>Wash with cool water mixed with dishwashing liquid. Let dry thoroughly before storing.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Mildew</b></td>
        <td>Use white vinegar or lemon juice full strength. Apply with a sponge or scrubby.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Head</b></td>
        <td>Sprinkle baking soda into the bowl, scrub with a brush.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Sink clog</b></td>
        <td>Pour 120 ml or more of baking soda down the drain, then add 250 ml of vinegar. Plug it up, and let it sit 10-15 min, then pour more hot water down. Repeat until clear.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Clothes</b></td>
        <td>Mix 2 cups of washing soda with the gratings from one 140 g bar of castile soap. Use 15 g for light loads, and 30 g for heavy loads. To whiten, disinfect, deodorize clothes of dish cloths, use sodium percarbonate at a ratio of 15 g per 5 L.</td>

<h2 id='diy_carbonation_system'>diy carbonation system</h2>
<img src='../media/content/knowledge/carbonation.jpg' />
<p>We do enjoy having some fizzy water now and again, but hate to have to purchase bottles for it. We decided against getting a soda stream given the fact that its bottles are proprietary and cannot be filled by anyone other than them. Making your own system is way better, and if you've got a big tank it'll last for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Here's what you'll need to get, this is also the order in which you need to connect them together:</p>
<ul>
    <li>5KG CO2 tank</li>
    <li>A regulator</li>
    <li>1m of of vinyl tubing</li>
    <li>A ball-lock keg coupler</li>
    <li>A carbonator bottle cap</li>
    <li>A soda bottle (for carbonation with a reinforced bottom).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='habitat'>habitat</h2>
<p>As with most things in life, 20% of anything does 80% of the work. When moving into a smaller space, it is important to find that 20% and surround yourself with things purposefully. Single-serving tools and kitchenware will not do.</p>
<p>Investing in good quality <b>army blankets and waterproof sleepingbags</b> will make a world of difference. Non-metallic(bamboo or ceramic) kitchenware is also essential, everything rusts on a boat - even stainless-steel. To keep our clothes dry, we store them in large sealed industrial plastic containers.</p>

<h2 id='water_storage'>water storage</h2>
<p>Our main tank carries 170 L, our secondary has 50 L, while an additional 100 L is stored in jerry cans. When it is not possible to dock at a marina, we use smaller(4x10L) jerry cans to ferry water from shore. While it requires more trips, the lighter containers are less prone to breakage.</p>

<h2 id='electricity'>electricity</h2><img src='../media/content/knowledge/leds.jpg' />
<p>We have 2 Solar Panels(1 x 100W and 1 X 90W). For additional power, we also carry a Honda EU1000i generator. Our boat has a 75AMP Balmar alternator, but it is only used to charge the batteries on cloudy days. Every single light is LED, cutting down the consumption of power, from lights, by 10 compared to halogens.</p>
<p>On Pino, we've got a total of 464 Ah. Our flooded-cell battery banks consists of a series configured starter bank (2x6 Volt Cells) and a series-parallel configured house bank (2x6V cells). Both sets are identical, equalling 12 v each. Because they're identical, we often use both as house banks.</p>
<p>There are working alternatives to most powered devices on a boat. We don't have a windlass, pressure faucet, water heater or a fridge. Because of this, it's easy to keep our power consumption low, reducing our need for extra solar, keeping our costs down and reducing the amount of things that can break, or fail.</p>

<h2 id='privacy'>privacy</h2>
<p>There is none. It's something you must prepare for. If you have plans to travel for extended periods of time with another person, you must be compatible, you must discuss problems when they arise and express concerns right away.</p>
<p>The combined space, below and atop deck, is bigger than it seems. If you are near land, there is always the option of going for a walk.</p>

<h2 id='laundry'>laundry</h2>
<p>In populated cities, we carry dirty clothes ashore to a laundromat. If there aren't any, we do our own washing. We wash them by hand with <a href='off_the_grid.html#rain_catchment'>collected rain water</a>, a set of buckets and a brush. The clothes are brushed and washed in soapy water once, then rinsed in fresh water.</p>
<p>For white clothes, or stained garments, we like to soak them in a bucket with some <a href='https://www.chemistrystore.com/sodium_percarbonate2.pdf' target='_blank'>sodium percarbonate</a>. It destains, deodorizes, whitens and is non-toxic to marine life. It breaks down to oxygen, water and sodium carbonate (soda ash) in your wash water.</p>
<p>When underway during long passages, we tend to wear the same clothes for a long, long time. If ever we do need to wash clothes, we'll do a quick salt water wash to save water, and rinse with fresh water. The clothes are hung out to dry on the lifelines, or on a separate line that we set up. Leaving dark clothes out to dry in the sun will cause it to discolour faster - such is the cost of sailing in warm places.</p>

<h2 id='costs'>costs</h2>
<p><b>Living aboard</b>: Living aboard your boat will incue extra costs due to wear from regular usage of the space. Wear will occur primarily inside the cabin, like the wearing of the varnish/finish on floors and counters, and of the regular use of plumbing in the galley and in the head. This goes on top of regular spendings on maintenance, the cost of which varies depending on the size, material and age of the boat. If staying at a marina in your home country for long periods, paying for 'liveaboard fees' (up to 150$ extra per month) is necessary. If staying in a marina in a foreign country, liveaboard fees are often waived.</p></p>

<p><b>Going offshore</b>: Traveling offshore costs more because the boat is under more stress. Repair and maintenance can cost between 500-800$ per year for a 10 m yacht like ours. This price goes up and down depending on where we go, and what has to be replaced that year. In 2018 while in New Zealand, we spent around <a href='projects_and_pain.html'>10,000$ on Pino</a> to get it ready for Japan and the subsequent trip to Canada. This was the most we'd spent in a year, and was due to the purchase of a new AIS system, mainsail, throttle cables, replacement windows, top hatch, galley plumbing, replacement batteries and solar panels.</p>

<p><b>Moorage</b>: Living at anchor, that is, in a bay somewhere tethered to the earth with <a href='sailing.html#ground_tackle'>ground tackle</a> is free. Some bays will have moorings installed that you can tie to for a small fee (often around 10-15$.) Marinas often have guest docks with power, wifi and showers, for a medium-to-high cost (300$-800$.) The longer the boat though, the bigger the cost. Some marinas though, charge per dock space rather than boat size, beware of these places. Moorage near cities is more expensive, and the price goes up during the high season (summer). Winter moorage is generally much cheaper. Paying for annual moorage is a good idea, but keeping a boat in a marina means getting liability insurance, which in turn, means you'll need a survey, resulting in a seemingly interminable domino effect which can incur many more costs. Depending the age of your boat, and when it was last surveyed (if ever), you may need a full condition out-of-water survey. This means paying a marina to lift your boat out, and paying the surveyor. A surveyor will point out mandatory items that need fixing and/or replacing, if these items are not complied with within 60 days the insurance will be void. Living at anchor is the cheap way to go, although getting good ground tackle (rode and anchor) is important as it will keep your boat safe.</p>

<p><b>Maintenance</b>: Doing maintenance and repairs yourself will bring the cost down. Offloading work to professionals, if you can afford it, is fine, but it's good to know how to take care of your boat because you may not always have access to workers if sailing to far-flung islands. Modern-built boats require less maintenance work than say, wooden boats. A failure to maintain items regularly will cost more later.</p>

<p>Maintenance checklist:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Engine(s)</li>
    <li>The boat’s hull (bottom) & topsides, electrical systems</li>
    <li>Electrical systems</li>
    <li>Plumbing</li>
    <li>Moving parts (hinges, tracks and zippers)</li>
    <li>Canvas and upholstery</li>
</ul>

<p>Tasks like hauling-out (to get the bottom painted) doesn't happen every year (once every 2-3 years for an offshore boat). Some years will cost more than others, as gear wears out, if hardware or lines need replacing. When doing repairs, use quality materials and products, research them thoroughly before a project instead of relying on brand names.</p>

<p><b>Safety</b>: Safety gear will last you many years if serviced regularly. Pyrotechnic signaling devices (including aerial flares and hand held signals) expire 42 months after the date of manufacture in accordance with the Coast Guard requirements. Typically, this means that you must replace your flares every three boating seasons. Aerial flares cost 75$ per pack of 6 (in Canada), for a boat our size (10m) we need to have 12 aboard. Life jackets and life rafts need to be serviced every 3 years, as the auto-inflating cannisters need testing, and replacing. Replacement cartridges for auto-inflating PFD's cost about 35$ (again, in Canada). If planning to travel for many years out of the country, carry replacement cartridges onboard, because other countries may not carry the ones required by your model and that replacements can't be shipped by air (they're pressurized). Re-packing a liferaft is very expensive, and varies depending on the model, and your location in the world.</p>
