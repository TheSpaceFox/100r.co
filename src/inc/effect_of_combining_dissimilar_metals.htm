<p>Take care when choosing hardware and fasteners for your boat. When dissimilar metals are placed in contact with each other, introducing an electrolyte(like fresh or saltwater) will trigger corrosion.</p>

<p>When water(electrolyte) is introduced onto metals that are very galvanically incompatible(ex: stainless steel and galvanized steel), one metal becomes a negatively-charged cathode, and the other a positively-charged anode. Electrons flow from the one to the other by way of the electrolyte. The two metals act as a battery and transfer electrons from one(the cathode) to the other(the anode).

<p style="background-color: black;">When selecting hardware aim for metals that are <b style="color:white;">white(safe)</b> in the following chart, do not mix metals intersecting at <b style="color:red;">red</b>(very problematic) or <b style="color:yellow;">yellow</b>(problematic).</p>
