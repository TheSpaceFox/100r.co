<p>Take care when choosing fasteners for your boat. When dissimilar metals are placed in contact with each other, introducing an electrolyte(like fresh or saltwater) will trigger corrosion.</p>

<p>When water(electrolyte) is introduced onto metals that are very galvanically incompatible(ex: stainless steel and galvanized steel), one metal becomes a negatively-charged cathode, and the other a positively-charged anode. Electrons flow from the one to the other by way of the electrolyte. The two metals act as a battery and transfer electrons from one(the cathode) to the other(the anode).</p>

<p>When selecting fasteners <b>do not mix metals shown as red or yellow in the following chart</b>. The following chart shows the safety or danger of mixing metals:</p>
