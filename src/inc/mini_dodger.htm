<p>In July 2020 we lost our sunbrella dodger at sea in the {north pacific ocean} after a big wave overwhelmed us from the stern. Since that day, we've been trying to find a worthwhile replacement.</p>

<p>This is what our old dodger looked like. The canvas was a bit worn already then, in 2016.</p>

<p>We saw this accident as an opportunity to do something different, something robust and that wouldn't cost us a fortune to build. To keep snow and rain outside while in port, we stitched up a {boom tent}.</p>

<p>We've been sailing without a dodger since that time, and we realized we both like having that part of the boat unobstructed.</p>

<p>The wide dodger we had prior to 2020 made it difficult to see up front, Rek was often standing on their tippy toes to see past it. We decided to build something that would only cover the companionway itself. Plus, we decided to put a solar panel just ahead of that space.</p>

<p>We wanted to build the mini dodger last year, but with the building of the {dry toilet}, the installation of the {woodstove} and the {engine rebuild}, we were thoroughly fed up with boat projects. Although, we still had time to build a wooden arch. We cut pieces with a jigsaw, glued and clamped them together and sanded the whole thing. We thought of the wood as the front of the arch, but were concerned it was too bulky. It wasn't high-quality wood, and to be strong it had to stay thick. When we left to sail for the summer we put it away in a locker and forgot about it.</p>

<p>This year, we went to borrow a swage tool from our good friend Peter, and we somehow started talking about the mini dodger and he told us he had a length of flat stainless steel that he wasn't using. It was exactly the length of our wooden arch. Peter has a better onboard workstop that we do, and he let us use his space to bend the metal to shape.</p>

<p>Using his vice, and a heavy crescent wrench, we bent the two ends into an L shape. The bottom of the Ls would rest on the cabin top. Then, we dug out the wooden arch and used it as a template for the 'curve' of the arch.</p>

<p>We clamped the metal to the wood, and secured it with a bunch of zip ties (heavy zip ties would have been better, but we used what we had). We built that wooden template well, because the wood did not buckle, or crack. Then, Devine went to work drilling holes so we could secure the arch to the boat. We drilled two holes on the bases, and two on the sides so that it wouldn't rock forward.</p>

<p>Drilling into stainless is a terrible affair, but it's a task that cannot be rushed! The trick is to drill hard, but slow, with plenty of lubrication. We had plenty of cobalt bits left over from the time when we drilled the broken stainless steel bolt out from our engine head last year (I still have nightmares about that).</p>

<p>With the length of metal still strapped to the wooden arch, we position the arch overtop of the companionway so we could mark up some drill holes. Pino has a thick, thick hull, we had to use extra long bolts. Once we removed the wooden arch the metal tried to spring back into a less aggressive bend, we bolted one end down and pulled it the other leg using a winch opposite of it. When it was well-positioned, we marked the hole, drilled through and secured the second leg.</p>

<p>We added some butyl tape around the bolts to keep water out, and some two washers per side (one undernearth, one up on top). From inside the boat, we added a lock nut on each side. We did this while it was blowing 30 kts outside as winter screams into spring.</p>

<p>More to come...</p>
