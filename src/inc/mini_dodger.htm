<p>In July 2020 we lost our sunbrella dodger at sea in the {north pacific ocean} after a big wave overwhelmed us from the stern. The force of it ripped out all of the deck ties, tore the sunbrella to pieces (material was old) and snapped the 100W flexi {solar} panel that was laying over it in half. Since that day, we've been trying to find a worthwhile replacement to protect that space from rain and wave wash.</p>

<p>This is what our old dodger looked like. The canvas was a bit worn already then, in 2016.</p>

<p>We saw this accident as an opportunity to do something different, something robust and that wouldn't cost us a fortune to build. To keep snow and rain outside while in port, we stitched up a {boom tent}.</p>

<p>We've been sailing without a dodger since that time, and we realized we both like having that part of the boat unobstructed.</p>

<p>The wide dodger we had prior to 2020 made it difficult to see up front, Rek was often standing on their tippy toes to see past it. We decided to build something that would only cover the companionway itself. Plus, we decided to put a solar panel just ahead of that space.</p>

<p>We wanted to build the mini dodger last year, but with the building of the {dry toilet}, the installation of the {woodstove} and the {engine rebuild}, we were thoroughly fed up with boat projects. Although, we still had time to build a wooden arch. We cut pieces with a jigsaw, glued and clamped them together and sanded the whole thing. We thought of using the wood as the front of the arch, but were concerned it was too bulky. It wasn't high-quality wood, and to be strong it had to stay thick. When we left to sail for the summer we put it away in a locker and forgot about it.</p>

<p>This year, we went to borrow a swage tool from our good friend Peter, and we somehow started talking about the mini dodger. He told us he had a length of flat stainless steel that he wasn't using. It was exactly the length of our wooden arch. Peter has a better onboard workstop that we do, and he let us use his space to bend the metal to shape.</p>

<p>Using his vice, and a heavy crescent wrench, we bent the two ends into an L shape. The bottom of the Ls would rest on the cabin top. Then, we dug out the wooden arch and used it as a template for the 'curve' of the arch.</p>

<p>We clamped the metal to the wood, and secured it with a bunch of zip ties (heavy zip ties would have been better, but we used what we had). We built that wooden template well, because the wood did not buckle, or crack. Then, Devine went to work drilling holes so we could secure the arch to the boat. We drilled two holes on the two 'feet', and two on the sides so that it wouldn't rock forward.</p>

<p>Drilling into stainless is a terrible affair, but it's a task that cannot be rushed! The trick is to drill hard, but slow, with plenty of lubrication. We had plenty of cobalt bits left over from the time when we drilled the broken stainless steel bolt out from our engine head last year (I still have nightmares about that).</p>

<p>With the length of metal still strapped to the wooden arch, we position the arch overtop of the companionway so we could mark up some drill holes. Pino has a thick, thick hull, we had to use extra long bolts. Once we removed the wooden arch the metal tried to spring back into a less aggressive bend, we bolted one end down and pulled it the other leg using a winch opposite of it. When it was well-positioned, we marked the hole, drilled through and secured the second leg.</p>

<p>We added some butyl tape around the bolts to keep water out, and some two washers per side (one undernearth, one up on top). From inside the boat, we added a lock nut on each side. We did this while it was blowing 30 kts outside as winter screams into spring.</p>

<p>We had some material (Sunforger's boat shrunk, a 100% 10 oz cotton marine canvas) left-over from our {boom tent} project that we wanted to re-use to make the canvas for the mini dodger. We would have liked to use burgundy, like the rest of our canvas, but it is expensive stuff and we like to try and use up material we already have. Also, we've never made anything like this before and somehow it is more reassuring to practice on inexpensive material first.</p>

<p>To make a pattern for a dodger, we'd recommend check out the Sail-rite tutorials, they offer very good advice. Of course, we didn't do exactly this because we don't have access to the same material, but our dodger is also smaller and easier to pattern. We took various measurements, drew templates and used that to cut our fabric. We left some room on the edges to make a good, clean seam.</p>

<p>We don't have enough needles to hold down a seam, and our stapler is too rusty, so we used tuck tape. The proper way to flatten seams to make it easier to stitch them, would be to iron them flat, lacking an iron, we misted the edge with a bit of water, and filled up a large metal measuring cup with hot water and ran it across the folded seam. It worked quite well.</p>

<p>Next step was to stitch the seams down, we double-stitched each seam using uv-resistant sail thread.</p>

<p>In all, to make the mini-dodger, we made 3 panels, and then stitched the 3 together. We made a big mistake, while trimming one of the side panels we accidently shortened it too much, and we had to add another length of fabric back in. Now, one side has a strip stitched on, and the design is assymetrical.</p>

<p>We did a lot of back and forth, doing tests fits on the arch, marking areas with a pencil, making cuts, re-adjusting etc. Eventually, we got it to fit.</p>

<p>Next, we have to re-enforce the part laying over the metal frame. We have some old marine vinyl from the {oars} projects that we can use, as well as some scraps of Sunbrella. We are still undecided. We also have to find a way to attach the fabric to the arch, and to the boat.</p>
