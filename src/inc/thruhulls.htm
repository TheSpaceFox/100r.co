<p>In May 2021, we closed 5 thru-hull: galley raw water sink intake, head intake, head outake, sink drain and macerator.</p>

<p>It was our first time attempting to close holes under the waterline. We kept most of the thru-hulls in the galley (sink, fore/aft cockpit drains and engine intake) but replaced all of fittings.</p>

<h3>Removing thru-hulls</h3>

<img src='../media/content/thruhulls/02.jpg' loading='lazy' title='Very old plumbing, as you can see...' />

<p>Three of the thru-hulls and piping in the head were seized, we had to use a grinder to cut through the threads to get them out. Not ideal. Luckily, both the macerator and galley sink fittings came out readily. We used a large pipe wrench to twist the inside fittings off.</p>

<p>It is easier to twist the thru-hulls out by first applying some heat, and by using a step wrench. Looking into a thru-hull, you can see the slots where you can insert the step wrench. We do not own this tool, but the local chandlery lends them out.</p>

<h3>Thru-hull replacement fittings</h3>

<p>Having never replaced fittings before, we weren't sure how to size the new fittings. While unscrewing the ball valves, we found the number written on the side. The two cockpit drains were 1 1/4", the sink drain was 1" and the engine intake was 3/4". The number was still clearly visible, even if the metal was worn out.</p>

<p>We bought marine bronze replacements at a marine chandlery. It is tempting to buy cheaper fittings at a regular hardware store, but they'll be made from yellow brass and won't last. Yellow brass and marine bronze bronze are not galvanically compatible. Brass fittings appear more yellow in color and have a smooth finish rather than a rough one (due to sand casting). We had difficulty finding bronze hose barbs (hose adapters). The local chandlery did not stock them, we had to order them out.</p>

<p>Others had recommended replacing them with a fibre-inforced plastic thru-hull (like Marelon or Thru-Design), but we had none available at the time.</p>

<p>We bought Groco flush-type thru-hull fittings (it's what the boat came with), although it was difficult to find. We could only get one 1 1/4" thru-hull, but saw they had intakes with a screen, so we bought it and cut the screen out (it worked out quite well). The pandemic has broken many of the supply chains, sometimes you can't wait to get the right part to finish the work.</p>

<p>We spent a lot of time agonizing over the mismatching of threads. We'd read it wasn't smart to combine an <b>NPS thread</b> with <b>NPT</b> because the threads don't match as well (less contact area). To fix this common issue, <b>Groco</b> sells thru-hulls with a <b>NPSM / NPT combination thread</b>. The peaks of the threads are machined off so that it is easier to match with a fitting with an NPS thread (common with ball valves, street elbows). Of course, this only works if you don't cut down the thru-hulls. We did not have to cut down ours in the end, we dry-fitted each part and found that they could all fit as is under the floorboards. In the end, we had a Groco fitting, with a street elbow (to reduce vertical clearance), to a ball valve, hose barb and then to a hose.</p>

<p>For a while, we considered getting the type of fitting supported with screws, but had to abandon that idea because of our lack of vertical clearance.</p>

<p>All of our new fittings are <b>marine-rated and bronze</b>, not cheap but quality fittings will last for a long, long time.</p>

<p>After the dry fitting, we squirted the outside of the hole with some <b>Sikaflex 291 marine sealant</b>, popped in the thru-hull fitting, added sealant from inside, inserted a step wrench into the slots below to keep the thru-hull from spinning while someone was inside threading the lock nut in, screwing it on tight. Even if our threads matched up, we added <b>teflon tape</b> on all connections.</p>

<h3>Closing thru-hulls</h3>

<p>Pino's hull is thick fibreglass, thicker on the floor behind the keel (where the galley thru-hulls are). We shut the holes in the head first, since they were on the side of the boat rather than overhead. We closed the macerator hole first, and confident, we moved on to close the other 3 in the head at once.</p>

<p>To make a good patch, it's necessary to sand the fibreglass around the hole down into a bevel. A good gradual bevel will provide strength. The size of the bevel depends on the thickness of the hull (measure the thickness with a caliper). The rule is to <b>multiply the thickness of the laminate by 12</b>. Say your hull is 12.7 mm, multiplied by 12 is 152.4 mm, which is the diameter of the bevel. We marked out the diameter on the hull, tape some wax paper on the inside of the boat with a weight overtop, and used a sander with 60 grit sand paper to fair out the hull.</p>

<p>We prepared our sheets of cut fibreglass beforehand. On a piece of wax paper we drew the outermost circle (of the diameter we measured earlier), and then drew circles of decreasing size within that one until we matched the size of the hole in the hull. It is better to cut the circles beforehand, because when you start applying epoxy it gets messy, and you don't want to waste time cutting more sheets. Using the pattern drawn on the wax paper, we cut out each circles (cutting into the pattern until we were down to the last, smallest circle). We cut circles of both biaxial and woven fibreglass fabric. Biaxial helps to add thickness quicker than if we were using just woven matting.</p>

<img src='../media/content/thruhulls/04.jpg' loading='lazy' title='Rekka cutting some fibreglass fabric into circles' />

<p>This is what we used to apply the sheets:</p>

<ul>
	<li>West Systems 105 epoxy resin</li>
	<li>West Systems 205 hardener</li>
	<li>West Systems 406 colloidal silica</li>
</ul>

<p>We cleaned the dust off the area with acetone, and mixed some epoxy thickened with the 406 colloidal silica (peanut butter consistency). We applied thickened epoxy into the hole, and layered on sheets of fibreglass fabric from the smallest circle to the largest (alternating between biaxial and woven), careful to line up fibres when layering woven matting. We used a glue brush to apply the epoxy onto the sheets, applying one sheet on the hole at a time. We also had a fibreglass roller, a useful too to spread the epoxy around evenly and to pop air bubbles. Others like to prepare mat 'sandwiches', which involves laying a few layers on a piece of cardboard, and adding epoxy to wet them thoroughy before applying them on the hull. Applying dry sheets on the hull directly just means that you have to add more epoxy so that the sheet layered over top will stick to it.</p>

<p>We let the patch dry, and the next day we scrubbed off the surface with a scotch pad, water and a bit of dishsoap to remove the amine blush. Nothing will stick well to amine blush. We let it dry, and sanded the area lightly, again, cleaning the dust off with some acetone. Then, we mixed up more thickened epoxy to fill out the rest of the holes. We used plastic scrapers to apply it, brushing off excess with one scraper, scooping it up with the other and applying it back. Having a wide scraper is necessary for this job, so that we could match the bevel of Pino's hull.</p>

<p>We also added thickned epoxy to the inside of the hole. It would have been better to add fibreglass sheeting to the inside too, we did it for the macerator hole, but we did not thick it was necessary for the rest after all.</p>

<p>The holes are barely discernible with bottom paint! We're glad we took the time to do this job, it was a good learning experience. We had good mentors helping us along the way (thank you Gerry and Rick), but we also referenced a lot of the <a href='https://youtu.be/b85sI8Re8VA' target='_blank'>West Systems videos on fibreglass repair</a> on YouTube. Their videos are very thorough and helpful.</p>

<p>We removed all the thru-hulls in the head so we could switch to a {composting head}.</p>
