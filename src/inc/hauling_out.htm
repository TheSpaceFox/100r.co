<p>Tasks like hauling-out (to get the bottom painted) is once every 2-3 years for an offshore boat, but can be every year otherwise. How often you haul out depends on your personal preference.</p>

<p>When out of the water, don't forget to...</p>

<ul>
    <li>Check your cutlass bearing (push up on the prop to see if there is any play, there shouldn't be).</li>
    <li>Grease the inside of your prop with calcium sulfonate(No. 130-AA) if you have a Max Prop.</li>
    <li>Replace the boat zincs (shaft, hull(if any)).</li>
    <li>Replace or service your shaft seal. Dripless types need to be replaced out of the water, because it is necessary to undo the engine coupling to pull back the shaft to remove, and insert a new bellow(see {propeller maintenance} to see our dripless seal replacement).</li>
    <li>Check the hull for blisters.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Bottom paint:</b> If we want to wait longer between haul-outs we paint more coats (2-3), otherwise 1 every year. We use ablative anti-fouling. Ablative wears out over time and when it does it will become less effective at repelling sea critters. Eventually, stripping the bottom of all paint down to the gelcoat is necessary, paint can build up and the older layers will start to flake off, making it difficult for new paint to adhere to the bottom. If painting the bottom from gel coat, adding a layer of primer is necessary so that the antifouling paint can adhere.</p>

<p><b>Strut and prop</b>: Coating your prop and strut with PropSpeed (see image below) works well to keep growth off, it works well in high-growth areas (we used it in New Zealand and Japan) but it is very expensive. Sailors often buy the product to share with others (helps keep costs down). There are also zinc-based sprays, or paint, that work quite well. See {propeller maintenance} if you want advice on maintaining a feathering propeller.</p>

<p>If your boat comes out of the water for a haul-out every year, a cheap alternative is to coat metal with zinc cream(penanten) or anhydrous lanolin (reported by others). Both products are available at the pharmacy. Note that it doesn't last very long.</p>
