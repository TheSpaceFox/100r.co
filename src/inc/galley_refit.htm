<p>A long time goal aboard Pino has been to get rid of our Force10 3-burner LPG oven, and to replace it with a single burner.</p>

<p>In the winter we use a single <a href="induction_cooking.html">induction plate</a>, we realized that we don't need more burners to cook. We hadn't use the oven in over 3 years, preferring to make food on the stovetop and to solar cook(see {solar cooking}) in the summer.</p>

<p>We re-homed our LPG stove, it has served us well these past 8 years but it is time to build our dream galley.</p>

<p>With the stove gone, we gain a lot of storage space in the galley. Our plan is to gimbal the single LPG burner, and to build drawers and shelves underneath it to store our cast iron cookware and our produce. We've been living without {refrigeration} since 2016, keeping our produce in bins in the v-berth.</p>

<p>The two white bins in the above photo hold our produce, they're just leaning there, but give a good idea of what it's going to look like. It'll be nice to have the produce near the galley again!</p>

<p>Single LPG burners are not common, but a local marine store found us a European model with a converter(+15$) for the LPG connection(North American standards differ a little bit). The unit was 400$ new, but we got it for 250$CAD because of a defect. The LPG components are fine, the defect is cosmetic(the top SS plate has a slight bend to it). </p>

<p>This burner is made by Eno, a company that has swallowed up the once Canadian-owned Force10(the makers of our former LPG stove).</p>

<p>We bought a length of pine meant for shelving and used a circular saw(borrowed from a friend) to cut it into 4. Two will serve as shelves, the other two will support the burner. Pine is very light, so we stained the wood with {coffee} to help darken the grain, and applied varnish-to strengten them, to protect them from humidity and to make them easier to clean.</p>

<p>It's still cold outside, but we make use of sunny days to do work on the dock.</p>

<p>The back of the shelves have a lip on one side to keep the pots from sliding out when the boat is heeled over. The front will have a horizontal bar, secured by two hardwood U blocks. The two U blocks will be bolted(x3) to the walls. A lot of the shelves on the boat use this same design to keep objects in place.</p>

<p>The above horizontal bar is an off-cut used to test the blocks, the actual bars will be much longer than this but this photo gives a good preview of what we are attempting to do.</p>

<p>The U in the blocks were carved using a handsaw, a drill and a round file. We used the handsaw to cut two parallel(ish) lines to accommodate the width of the horizontal bar, then drilled a hole in the bottom of the U to help shave away some material(using the fattest drill bit we had), and then removed some of the left-over material with the round file. A chisel would work well, but we don't have one.</p>

<p>We carry a lot of small lengths of hard wood that are ideal for projects like this, wood that we've accumulated over the years, found on marina shelves, gifted by friends, bought at used marineware stores etc. We made the blocks out of some short lengths of teak.</p>

<p>When we were docked in Minamiise in {Japan}, (see {a home for pino}), the local yatch club were re-doing the docks out of some exotic hardwood and so we inherited a lot of small offcuts from them (they were throwing them away). The grain is a dark brown and we think it's from Central/South America, it might be Ipe or Tropical Walnut.</p>

<p>More updates on this project soon...</p>
