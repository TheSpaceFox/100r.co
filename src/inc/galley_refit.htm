<p>A long time goal aboard Pino has been to replace our Force10 3-burner LPG oven and to replace it with a single burner.</p>

<p>In the winter we got used to cooking with a single <a href="induction_cooking.html">induction plate</a>, and we hadn't use the oven in over 3 years, preferring to make food on the stovetop and to solar cook(see {solar cooking}) in the summer.</p>

<p>We re-homed our LPG stove, it has served us well these past 8 years but it is time to build our dream galley.</p>

<p>With the stove gone, we gained a lot of storage space in the galley. We gimballed the single LPG burner, and built drawers and shelves underneath it to store our cast iron cookware and our produce.</p>
