<p>A long time goal aboard Pino has been to replace our Force10 3-burner LPG oven and to replace it with a single burner.</p>

<p>We re-homed our LPG stove, it has served us well these past 8 years but it is time to build our dream galley. With the stove gone, we gained a lot of storage space. We gimballed the single LPG burner, and built drawers and shelves underneath it to store our cast iron cookware and our produce.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that this wasn't a spontaneous decision, we have been preparing for this for a long time. We hadn't used the oven in over 3 years, and practiced cooking with a single <a href="induction_cooking.html">induction plate</a> over 4 winters, after the experiment we realized we didn't need more than one burner. We don't limit ourselves to one-pot meals, we wait for the burner to free up to finish preparing a dish that requires the use of different pots/pans.</p>

<p>Living without an oven is not a concern. Overtime, we learned to make cookies, flat bread, cake, and pizza on the stovetop, and in the summer we made crunchy baguettes(see {solar cooking}).</p>

<p>Our galley design is far from perfect, we're not professionals, we are tinkerers and we like to iterate and learn. A galley like this is suited for people comfortable with adapting recipes, and who are interested in living without {refrigeration}.</p>
