<p>A long time goal aboard Pino has been to get rid of our Force10 3-burner LPG oven, and to replace it with a single burner.</p>

<p>In the winter we use a single <a href="induction_cooking.html">induction plate</a>, we realized that we don't need more burners to cook. We hadn't use the oven in over 3 years, preferring to make food on the stovetop, and to solar cook in the summer.</p>

<p>We re-homed our LPG stove, it has served us well these past 8 years but it is time to build our dream galley.</p>

<p>With the stove gone, we gain a lot of storage space in the galley. Our plan is to gimbal the single LPG burner, and to build drawers and shelves underneath it to store our cast iron cookware and our produce. We've been living without {refrigeration} since 2016, keeping our produce in bins in the v-berth.</p>

<p>The two white bins in the above photo hold our produce, they're just leaning there, but give a good idea of what it's going to look like. It'll be nice to have the produce near the galley again!</p>

<p>Single LPG burners are not common, but a local marine store found us a European model with a converter(+15$) for the LPG connection(North American standards differ a little bit). The unit was 400$ new, but we got it for 250$CAD because of a defect. The LPG components are fine, the defect is cosmetic(the top SS plate has a slight bend to it). </p>

<p>This burner is made by Eno, a company that has swallowed up the once Canadian-owned Force10(the makers of our former LPG stove).</p>

<p>More updates on this project soon...</p>
