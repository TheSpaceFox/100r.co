<p>These bikes have traveled far with us. We crossed oceans with them aboard our boat, and did not regret bringing them along.</p>

<p>We experimented with various ways to stow them, but the best way was to take both wheels off, to remove the pedals, turn the handle bars sideways, and to tie all components with straps. Then, we put them in bike bags, and stored them in our quarter berth.</p>

<p>The bags are nothing special, but allowed us to carry them with us aboard trains while in Japan.</p>
