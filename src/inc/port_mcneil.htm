<p>We had a rough, short transit to Port McNeil(B.C, Canada) from Telegraph Cove. The wind was blowing 20-25 knots that day, coming out of where? Out of where we need to go always, of course! Such is the nature of sailing in this region.</p>

<p>We've sailed in that kind of weather often when offshore, but the dangers are many near land. We had to dodge islands, boat traffic, ferries, and contend with ever-increasing waves and wind. The current was with us, but wind opposing current makes for even larger waves. In fact, 1 knot of current opposing the wind creates waves normally associated with 10 extra knots of wind. By the end the sea was covered with whitecaps. With 2 reefs in, Pino handled it fine, but maneuvering with so many dangers around you is very scary.<p>

<p>We sailed from the mouth of one harbor to the other, at least this much wind permitted that. No one else was sailing that day, we were the only fools out there. The wind really funnels between Malcom Island and Vancouver Island. To try and get more sailing space we tried to go north of Cormorant Island, but that turned out to be a mistake... somehow the wind there was worse.</p>

<p>Once behind the ledge to the north of Port McNeil, we got to work trying to douse the sails in this terrible, terrible weather. Furling the jib is really difficult in high winds, even when facing into it, so sometimes we roll it in wrong. Rolling it wrong means that the wind can catch in it. The result is the top part of the sail fills with air and balloons out while the bottom is still furled. The wind causes the pocket of air in the sail to flail violently which shakes the entire rig in a very scary way. This has happened to us before, and it happened just a few feet away from the Municipal docks. Wonderful. Rek was inside on the radio confirming our slip and had to rush outside to help with the maneuvers. The only way we found to fix this is to do a 360 degree turn.</p>

<p>We had to do this twice. After the first turn we could open the sail again to furl in, but then it furled wrong again... so we had to do another turn. Then the jib got rolled in well, it's a very harrowing thing to do when you're just off a marina dock. The reefed main gave us no such trouble.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the only spot available in Port McNeil was only partially shielded from the wind waves, so we got our asses kicked all night at the dock too. North Island marina was full up, we didn't expect that, and the Municipal docks only had the wave-pool side of G available, which sticks out far and isn't well protected from wind-driven waves. The harbourmaster felt sorry for us, he assigned our poor weather-battered boat another spot. We couldn't move to it until the next day though, the wind and water was keeping us pinned to the dock. The fenders held the boat off the dock, while the stern line, with a snubber, absorbed the rest of the shock.</p>

<p>We went to do errands in town to try and forget this weather. We went to get some fresh food at the IGA, a short walk away, and went to visit Shoprite to try and buy a hatchet and some firewood for our woodstove. We've been running it often these days, the mornings and evenings are very cold, even more so when it is raining.</p>

<p>We moved the next morning to a more sheltered location. There, we tried our new hatchet and went to work splitting the logs. Our firebox can only accomodate short lenghts of wood, so after splitting the logs we usually have to cut them down with a hacksaw.</p>

<p>We also went to see the biggest burl in the world, a local attraction. The burl comes from a Sitka spruce. <i>"Discovered in 2005, the Ronning Burl from Holberg on northern Vancouver Island is estimated to weigh nearly 30 tonnes (33 US tons). The burl was cut from a 525-year-old spruce and measured 6 m wide and 6 m tall (19 ft 8 in x 19 ft 8 in), with a circumference of around 13.7 m (45 ft)</i>[<a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/79033-largest-tree-burl" target="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/79033-largest-tree-burl">Source</a>]. Unfortunately, the burl was set aflame last year by some teenagers. Now the burl is half-charred. When we saw it, it was sitting in gravel, with tape marking the area around it to keep people away in case it decided to roll. We're not sure what plans they have for it, it is certainly less majestic than it used to be.</p>
