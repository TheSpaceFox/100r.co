<p>One morning anchored in {hathayim marine park}, we were sitting on deck with our feet pressing up against the lifelines. We like to take our coffee up on deck when the weather's nice. With our eyes on the lifelines we said: "I wonder if the metal is all corroded under the plastic covering..."</p>

<p>On a sailboat, lifelines are important. They act as handholds when sailing, and in some instances it is the thing that can keep you from falling overboard. Other sailors had warned us that if water could get under the covering that it could corrode the metal. The lifeline coverings on Pino were old, cracked in a few places with some red staining the surface. We talked about removing it before, but never found the time. We figured that there would be some corrosion, given the age of the boat, and so on that morning we decided to strip the covering off to find out how bad it was.</p>

<p>We each grabbed a knife, and went to work. The plastic came off easy, and we saw the damage underneath. Some of the wires had cuts.</p>

<p>Stainless steel wire is made up of many more smaller wires, like ropes. If one is cut, the rest can still hold the line but the more cuts there are the weaker it becomes, and if the wire is under load then it can break. Our lifelines weren't as damaged as we thought, but we would not trust them to go offshore.</p>

<p>We removed all of the plastic covering, with plans to replace the lifelines sometime in 2023. Replacing the wire itself is not costly, but the hardware linking them to the stanchions and the swaging (how you connect the wire to the hardware that connects to the stanchions) are not cheap. We are considering using dyneema, but we are not yet sure.</p>

<p>It's time. Today we took off all of the lower lifelines so we can start replacing them. We're replacing these first because the upper ones currently have christmas lines hanging onto them(with a holiday event coming soon).</p>

<p>Many of the wires had meat hooks(wires that have parted), or cracksâ€”dangerous stuff.</p>

<p>We bought some lengths of 5 mm Amsteel for our lifelines. We also decided to use hardware(8 jaw&jaw turnbuckles) to link up the lifeline to the stanchions because at least one of two ends needs to be adjustable so the lifeline can be tightened as desired(the lines will stretch before settling in). All bits of Amsteel will terminate with eye splices(with thimbles), linked up to one side with jaw&jaw turnbuckles and with shackles on the other ends.</p>

<h3>Project price list</h3>
<ul>
	<li>40m 5mm Amsteel blue-black, <b>200$</b></li>
	<li>16x SS thimbles(that match the thickness of the dyneema), <b>20$</b></li>
	<li>8x6.35mm(1/4 in) Jaw&Jaw turnbuckles, <b>166$</b></li>
	<li>TOTAL: <b>430$</b></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note</b>. A good fid is necessary to make lifelines with Amsteel.</p>

<p>One end is terminated by an eye splice, the other by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOBs_aCxZ0c" target="_blank">Mobius Brummel Eye Splice</a>(YouTube), which uses one tail since since it's not possible to pass a second tail through.</p>

<p>The tail that will be buried has to be 72 times the diameter of the line. A tail that is too short can weaken a splice, Amsteel is a very slippery material. It is better to make the tail too long than too short.</p> 

<p><b>5mm x 72 = 360mm(36cm, 14 in)</b>, our tail will be 36 cm long.</p>

<p>If planning to race your boat, keep in mind that some racing authorities don't allow the use of HMPE rope for lifelines. In all though, this material has been thoroughly tested, just as long as it has chafe protection in the right places, and that the splice is good. In their guidelines, World Sailing states that 5mm is the <a href="https://www.sailing.org/tools/documents/WorldSailingOffshoreSpecialRegulations20182019v2-%5b24802%5d.pdf#page=15" target="_blank">recommended minimum</a> for boats larger than 8.5m. Boats smaller than this can use 4 mm.</p>

<p>Advice for fitting synthetic lifelines:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Thick lifelines</b>. As big as possible, to get at least 2 times more breaking strength as the SS it is replacing. Larger diameter is also more pleasant to hold.</p>
	<li><b>End fittings</b>. They ought to have a minimum of 5/1 bending ratio.</li>
	<li><b>Chafe protection</b>. Add sacrificial covers where the line passes through the hole in the stanchion post, especially if the stanchions are hollow(ours aren't).</li>
	<li><b>Frequent Inspection</b>. Like all hardware, these should be looked at often for chafe and general degradation.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>UV Resistance?</b> Supposedly, lab tests have shown that synthetic rope sees more UV damage initially but then becomes opaque to UV, the material forms a protective layer and the rate of UV damage goes down to near nothing after a short time in the sun. (We are looking for information of those lab tests to link here.)</p>
