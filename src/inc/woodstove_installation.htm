<h3>Inside</h3>
<p>Built a base, stained it with {coffee} and epoxied the wood to strengten, and protect it. The bottom of the base was later re-enforced with some teak. The base leaves room for a drawer, where we can store tools or stove accessories, while giving access to the water tank underneath.</p>
