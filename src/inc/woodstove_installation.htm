<h3> Why a wood stove?</h3>

<p>It was our dream to have a little wood stove aboard Pino. After researching stoves, we decided that the best model was the cast iron Sardine wood stove from Navigator Stoveworks.</p>

<p>Our Espar, forced air diesel heater broke on our last passage, and we decided not to replace it. In all, we're trying to remove fossil fuels from our lives, and this was the first step.</p>

<p>There are few low-power alternatives to a gas/diesel heater for heating a boat when {off the grid}. A wood stove was our best low-tech option. We also like that it doubles as a cook top.</p>

<h3>Planning the installation</h3>

<p>The stove needed room, but we were prepared to make room for it. In the end, we didn't have to sacrifice too much. We found a spot for it on the port side settee, nearest to the bow.</p>

<p>When planning the install, we made a rough model of the stove with wood, and drew the top of the stove on paper to figure out how to align the flue to the ceiling. We followed the <a href='http://www.marinestove.com/manual.htm' target='_blank'>guidelines</a> recommended by our stove builder. All stoves are different, always refer to the builder when planning an install.</p>

<p>Our installation was tricky, because we had to built a sturdy base to support the stove, while still having access to the space underneath it, and behind it (on both sides). The forward wall is where we stow our table when underway, so we had to leave space for that, and the other wall has a locker for storage, which also gives us access to the chain plate bolts. We made the decision to not attach the wall-shield close to the wall, but to secure it to a base (that we will built) which in turn will be secured to the port-side settee. The base sits over our water tank, which has two plates over top. We open these when we clean the tank, so we wanted to keep them both accessible.</p>

<p>With these limitations in mind, we planned our installation.</p>

<p>The locker sitting behind the wall shield was on hinges, so we removed those and instead built slides out of wood, and a wooden handle. We can easily reach and pull it out from the side. It is not easy to store items there anymore, but that's okay, our main goal is to keep hand access to the back chain plate bolts.</p>

<h3>The base</h3>

<p>We built a base out of pine. We are lucky to have a hardware store nearby that can do cuttings on-site with a bench saw. We don't have access to such tools, and it is hard to make straight cuts without it. We cut a groove in the 3 'walls' of the base to help support the 'floor' of the base. When assembled it holds together, but to strengthen it we added screws.</p>

<p>Pine is very light-colored, so we stained it with {coffee} to match it with the rest of the woodwork. We'd read of hobbyists use coffee as a stain, and thought we'd give it a shot! It's cheap, and doesn't stink. We added a layer of epoxy resin to seal the wood and stain to protect it from moisture, and to deter insects.</p>

<p>The bottom of the base was later re-enforced with a length of teak. The base leaves room for a drawer underneath, where we can store tools or stove accessories, while giving access to the water tank. We secured the base to the wall with two long hex bolts, with oversized washers and lock nuts.</p>

<h3>Wall shielding</h3>

<p>Shielding is important on a boat due to the fact that most boat building materials or finished located near the stove will not have a <b>Flame Spread Index of 75 or less</b>. A shield will protect combustible materials in the vicinity of the stove.</p>

<p>The most effective heat shields are the <b>air cooled type</b>, separated by a thick sheet of stainless steel with 2.54 cm (1 in) or more of air space behind the metal sheet and around the edges to allow air to flow. A proper air cooled heat shield reduces clearances by up to 2/3.</p>

<p>Air space provides a R value of 1.43 per 2.54 cm (1 in), and an K value of 0.7.</p>

<p>Our stove builder recommends making a composite panel, mounting a sheet of mineral fibre board behind it to further reduce clearances. Because we exceed the minimum air space requirements, we did not add one.</p> 

<p>We found some stainless steel sheeting and a shelf at a scrap yard. The shelf had a bent edge, which was perfect to make a shield with (makes for a nicer finish). We didn't have access to a place that could bend sheets for us, so we were glad to skip that step. We cut the shelf in half using a grinder. Then, we sanded the edges (because they are sharp).</p>

<img src='../media/content/woodstove/install5.jpg' title='Rekka is wearing protective eye wear, dont worry...' loading='lazy'/>

<p>We used a lot of cobalt drill bits to make holes in the shield (drilling through SS sucks). The key is to go slow, hard, and to use plenty of lubrication.</p>

<p>We secured the corners of the shield together with bolts (3 in all). We also drilled holes at the top corners of the wall shield to secure it to the wall.</p>

<img src='../media/content/woodstove/shield.jpg' loading='lazy'/>

<p>Our dock neighbor gave us some stainless steel piping that we cut down to 2.54 cm (1 inch) to use as vertical spacers for the wall shield, to allow air to circulate. Our wall shield was then mounted on the base, and attached to the port-side wall with 2 beefy hex bolts, oversized washers and lock nuts.</p>

<h3>Floor protection</h3>

<p>Our stove requires a non-combustible protection layer with a minimum <b>R-value of R2</b> (thermal resistance). With K values (measure of heat conductivity), the lower value is a better insulator. With R Values, the highest number is better.</p>

<p>To protect our wooden base, we bought a 13x1219x609 mm (0.5x48x24 in) sheet of <b>Micore 300</b>. Micore 300 is mineral fibre board with an R value of 2.06 per 26 mm (1 in), so 2 layers meets the specifications for our stove.</p>

<p>Sourcing this material was not easy. Fireplace stores make floor pads with it, but rarely sell raw sheets of the material. We found a distributor online (Concorde distributing), and they were able to direct us to a place where we could buy it locally. Our friends drove us to Saanichton to Pacific Fireplaces to get it. We wanted this material because it is thin, light, with a good R value per thickness. Our other option was layering sheets of X-rated gypsum, but we would have had to layer almost 76 mm (3 in) to get a value of R2—not ideal.</p>

<p>We cut the Micore 300 with a utility knife, layered over plywood. Micore is brittle, you can snap/break it to complete a cut but to have sharp edges, we recommend cutting all the way through to the plywood. Micore is made with silica, so we wore gloves and cut it while outside, careful not to breath any dust.</p>

<img src='../media/content/woodstove/micore.jpg' loading='lazy'/>

<p> To reflect heat and to protect the Micore, we placed a sheet of stainless steel over top.</p>

<p>We secured the wall shield to the base with hex bolts, oversized washers and lock nuts. The vertical spacers provide stability. The through-bolts for the stove legs are also secured with this.</p>

<h3>Chimney pipe</h3>

<p>We bought 10 cm (4 in) stainless steel stove pipes for Dickinson stoves: two 45-degree elbows, and two 60 cm (24 inch) long straight pipes.</p>

<p>We bought single-wall stove pipes, instead of insulated. Our stove builder said it wasn't necessary. The water deck iron (see below) does a good job of keeping the pipe cool.</p>

<p>We cut the pipes to size using our grinder, and secured them together with sheet metal screws. We made small leading holes with a cobalt bit first to make it easier. We used our hand drill to secure them, careful not to over tighten them.</p>

<h3>Flue damper</h3>

<p>We installed a flue damper in the pipe to control draft. It was difficult to slide into the space. The stove builder recommend that the damper be placed roughly 76 cm (30 in) above the cook surface.</p>

<img src='../media/content/woodstove/fluedamper.jpg' loading='lazy'/>

<p>Our stove has an oval collar, so we hand formed the pipe to fit it. Then, we used high-temp stove cement to connect the chimney pipe to the collar, gooping up the inside of the pipe. We let it set for a day.</p>

<p>We have plans to add shielding to the pipe itself as it nears the ceiling. The stove pipe will never get too hot because of the water deck iron. This traditional fitting contains water in a through which surrounds and cools the chimney pipe as it passes through the deck.</p>

<h3>Deck ring</h3>

<p>Built a ring so the pipe comes out vertically, and so that the water deck iron is level with the deck. Pino's cabin top has a very gradual curve.</p>

<p>We cut a hole in the deck using a jigsaw. To make sure the hole was aligned with the interior pipe, we drilled a small leading hole first. We measured correctly, the leading hole was perfectly aligned inside. We taped a bag inside to catch some of the dust, then proceeding to drilling additional holes on the edges so we could run the jigsaw blade. Then, came time to cut a big gaping hole on Pino's deck—scary!</p>

<img src='../media/content/woodstove/hole2.jpg' loading='lazy'/>

<p>We put a rope through the hole with a knot on the inside, and attached the bitter end to a point on deck to keep the core from falling inside.</p> 

<img src='../media/content/woodstove/hole.jpg' loading='lazy'/>

<p>Pino's got a thick, thick core...</p>

<img src='../media/content/woodstove/install3.jpg' loading='lazy'/>

<p>We cut the ring at an angle with a jigsaw to level out the deck iron, and fibreglassed it to the deck. We painted the ring so it would match Pino's gel coat color.</p>

<img src='../media/content/woodstove/install4.jpg' loading='lazy'/>

<h3>Water deck iron</h3>

<p>The last step was to secure the brass deck iron to the deck.</p>

<p>We glued some thin rubber spacers on the top of the ring, so that the deck iron sits on a good layer of high-heat silicone (a warning, that stuff STINKS). Without the spacers, most of the silicone would come gushing out. Then, we taped the outside of the ring to make ensure a clean edge for the silicone.</p>

<p>We layered some silicone on the top of the ring, and laid the deck iron over top, careful to insert it in the stove pipe and to align it with the holes that we previously drilled on the top of the ring. Then, we fastened it down with some brass screws, and removed the excess stinky silicone.</p>

<p>We have plans to add some screws inside too, to further secure the ring to the deck. We don't feel it is necessary to have through-bolts.</p>

<h3>Smoke head</h3>

<p>Pino looks great with the stainless steel smoke head! We won't be sailing with it on deck, we'll swap it out with a rubber bung while underway. The last thing we want is for a line to get caught in it and to send it flying overboard.</p>

<img src='../media/content/woodstove/outsidefinal.jpg' loading='lazy'/>

<p>Voila! We finished most of the install on April 20th 2021. We still have some small modifications to make to our setup, but it is mostly done—just in time for summer (haha).</p>

<p>We also got a little <b>EcoFan</b> by Caframo. The fan helps to distribute heat throughout the space, helps save up to 10% of fuel, and doesn't use any power! The EcoFan is a little fan powered by a single TEG mat in between a diffuser and a support leg. It's powered by thermoelectricity. It's such a neat idea. We're hoping to experiment with these little mats to see if we can capture an amp or two from the wood stove.</p>

<p>It is difficult to find stove tools sized for a boat, but luckily, <a href='https://cubicminiwoodstoves.com/' target='_blank'>Cubic Mini</a> has a great miniature set (CB-3010). We also purchaed the EcoFan there, since they were the only store stocking the smaller model (CB-800CAXBX, original).</p>
