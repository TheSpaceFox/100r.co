<p>Iggy the dinghy was a 1.8 m(6 ft) Plastimo PVC inflatable dinghy. We purchased it in Nanaimo in May 2016. It carried us from ship to shore for many years, until it succumbed to UV damage in 2019. Iggy was named after an android in the anime Ergo Proxy (like many things on {Pino}).</p>

<p>We rowed Iggy a lot in the beginning, so often that the oar locks broke. Rowing an inflatable with a flat bottom is no easy task, especially when carrying two full-sized road {bikes}. We did this anyway. Sometimes, you have to work with what you've got. We bought an old Evinrude outboard in San Francisco at Blue Pelican, a used marine goods store, but we never got it to work. We traded it at a store in San Diego, paying the difference another working outboard. We named this outboard {Turnip}, and affixed it to Iggy's rump.</p>

<p>Our favorite Iggy moment was in {New Zealand}, when we took part in a dinghy river raft-up in Whangarei. The dinghies and owners meet at the bridge downtown, tie themselves together with ropes, and drift away... carried by the ebbing tide. We had drinks on the water, chatting away and having fun. Then, when the river carried the dinghies up to the Bone Bridge, all the dinghies parted and motored, or rowed back home up river.</p>

<p>We reycled Iggy (RIP) while in Japan, and now, today in 2021, we are Iggy-less... and hope to find a suitable, rowable, hard-bottomed companion soon.</p>
