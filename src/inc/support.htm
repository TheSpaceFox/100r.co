<p>We enjoy the challenges that come with living on a boat. The {power} limitations and reduced connectivity has re-shaped how we work â€” in a good way. We now create our own software (see {mission}), an open-source ecosystem (see {tools ecosystem}) of creative tools. We document our experience on this website, which doubles as a wiki.</p>

<p>All the donations we get are re-invested back into our projects.</p>
