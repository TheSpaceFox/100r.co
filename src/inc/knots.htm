<p>A knot used to make a secure closed loop (necessary when making a prusik knot). This knot is made up of 2 knots that slide together when tightened, to form the final knot (kids use this knot to make simple adjustable bracelets).</p>

<p>The gripping sailor's hitch is a friction hitch that won't jam, and won't slip when pulled on lengthwise along the object. It's used to tie to an object where the ends aren't accessible, like for one rope to another, or to a rope to a long rod/pole. This type of knot will even grip on an object that is tapered.</p>

<p>The Prusik Knot is an excellent knot to use to climb up the mast. It uses no hardware that might fail, it's easy to slip up and down the halyard, and locks under pressure. Using this along with a bosun's chair, safety lines and foot holds (made of strong webbing) is an efficient and safe way to go up the mast without requiring someone to winch you up.</p>
