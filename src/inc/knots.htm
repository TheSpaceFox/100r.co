<ul>
    <li><b>Name</b>: Square knot (or reef knot)</li>
    <li><b>Type</b>: Binding(friction)</li>
    <li><b>Function</b>: Secures a line around an object. Not suitable with lines of different diameters, not as secure as a bend(unless additional knots are used).</li>
    <li><b>Marine use:</b> Used to secure a reef in a sail.</li>
</ul>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/sheet_bend.jpg' title='sheet bend' loading='lazy'/>

<ul>
    <li><b>Name</b>: Sheet Bend</li>
    <li><b>Type</b>: Bend</li>
    <li><b>Function</b>: Joins lines of different diameters, can work loose when there is no load (for extra strength make a <a href="../media/content/knowledge/double_sheet_bend.jpg">double sheet bend</a>)</li>
    <li><b>Marine use:</b> Used to extend a line, to make a tow rope, etc.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><b>Name</b>: Round turn and two half-hitches</li>
    <li><b>Type</b>: Hitch</li>
    <li><b>Function</b>: Secures a line to a fixed object</li>
    <li><b>Marine use:</b> Used to tie a dockline around a bull rail, or post.</li>
</ul>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/bowline.jpg' title=bowline loading='lazy'/>

<ul>
    <li><b>Name</b>: Bowline</li>
    <li><b>Type</b>: Loop</li>
    <li><b>Function</b>: Makes a fixed loop at the end of a line. This is a non-jamming knot. With certain materials, can work its way loose when there is no load.</li>
    <li><b>Marine use:</b> Used to secure the working end of a sheet to the clew of a headsail.</li>
</ul>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/double_fishermans_knot.jpg' title='double fishermans knot' loading='lazy'/>

<ul>
    <li><b>Name</b>: Double fisherman's knot</li>
    <li><b>Type</b>: Bend</li>
    <li><b>Function</b>: Makes a secure closed loop. This knot is made up of 2 knots that slide together when tightened, to form the final knot (kids use this knot to make simple adjustable bracelets).</li>
    <li><b>Marine use:</b> Used to make a closed loop to use with a prusik knot to climb the mast.</li>
</ul>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/rolling_hitch.jpg' title='rolling hitch' loading='lazy'/>

<ul>
    <li><b>Name</b>: Rolling hitch</li>
    <li><b>Type</b>: Hitch</li>
    <li><b>Function</b>: Used to tie one rope to another, or to a pole, for lengthwise pull along an object rather than for a pull at right angles (works for a single direction of pull). It is effective for moderate loads, won't hold as well with modern slippery synthetic ropes (use gripping sailor's hitch instead).</li>
    <li><b>Marine use:</b> Used to pull a line lengthwise, say to take pressure off a sheet in the event of a jam.</li>
</ul>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/gripping_sailors_hitch.jpg' title='gripping sailors hitch' loading='lazy'/>

<ul>
    <li><b>Name</b>: Gripping sailor's hitch</li>
    <li><b>Type</b>: Hitch</li>
    <li><b>Function</b>: Used to tie a rope to an object, or to another rope. This knot doesn't jam, and won't slip when pulled lengthwise along the object. It has more grip than a rolling hitch, even on tapered objects and performs well with synthetic ropes.</li>
    <li><b>Marine use:</b> Used to pull a line lengthwise with a heavy load at the end, like an anchor rode.</li>
</ul>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/prusik.jpg' title='prusik knot' loading='lazy'/>

<ul>
    <li><b>Name</b>: Prusik knot</li>
    <li><b>Type</b>: Hitch, binding(friction).</li>
    <li><b>Function</b>: Used to attach a loop of cord around a rope, it locks onto the rope when under load, but slips up and down well when the load is released.</li>
    <li><b>Marine use</b>: Used instead of ascenders to climb a mast, doesn't damage the rope it is secured to when sliding.</li>
</ul>
