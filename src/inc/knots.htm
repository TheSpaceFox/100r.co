<img src='../media/content/knowledge/double_fishermans_knot.jpg' title='double fishermans knot' loading='lazy'/>

<ul>
    <li><b>Name</b>: Double fisherman's knot</li>
    <li><b>Type</b>: Bend</li>
    <li><b>Function</b>: Makes a secure closed loop. This knot is made up of 2 knots that slide together when tightened, to form the final knot (kids use this knot to make simple adjustable bracelets).</li>
    <li><b>Marine use:</b> Used to make a closed loop to use with a prusik knot to climb the mast.</li>
</ul>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/rolling_hitch.jpg' title='rolling hitch' loading='lazy'/>

<ul>
    <li><b>Name</b>: Rolling hitch</li>
    <li><b>Type</b>: Hitch</li>
    <li><b>Function</b>: Used to tie one rope to another, or to a pole, for lengthwise pull along an object rather than for a pull at right angles (works for a single direction of pull). It is effective for moderate loads, won't hold as well with modern slippery synthetic ropes (use gripping sailor's hitch instead).</li>
    <li><b>Marine use:</b> Used to pull a line lengthwise, say to take pressure off a sheet in the event of a jam.</li>
</ul>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/gripping_sailors_hitch.jpg' title='gripping sailors hitch' loading='lazy'/>

<ul>
    <li><b>Name</b>: Gripping sailor's hitch</li>
    <li><b>Type</b>: Hitch</li>
    <li><b>Function</b>: Used to tie an object where the ends aren't accessible, for one rope to another, or to a pole. This knot doesn't jam, and won't slip when pulled lengthwise along the object. It has more grip than a rolling hitch, even on tapered objects and performs well with synthetic ropes.</li>
    <li><b>Marine use:</b> Used to pull a line lengthwise with a heavy load at the end, say an anchor rode.</li>
</ul>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/prusik.jpg' title='prusik knot' loading='lazy'/>

<ul>
    <li><b>Name</b>: Prusik knot</li>
    <li><b>Type</b>: Hitch</li>
    <li><b>Function</b>: Used to attach a loop of cord around a rope, it locks onto the rope when under load, but slips up and down well when the load is released.</li>
    <li><b>Marine use</b>: Used instead of ascenders to climb a mast, doesn't damage the rope it is secured to when sliding.</li>
</ul>
