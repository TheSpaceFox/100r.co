<p>Insulation cooking involves bringing a dish to boil, turning the heat off, covering the dish with a lid, and placing it in an insulated container. Over a period of time, the dish cooks by the heat captured in the insulated container. Cooking food this way brings fuel consumption down threefold. The only requirement is that the food must be prepared ahead of time, since the cooking time is longer. It is useful on a boat, when a meal is cooked once in the morning with it ready to eat later in the day, still hot.</p>

<p>There are insulation cookers on the market, but it is possible to make one for cheap by using thick blankets or a sleeping bag. To make a quick insulated space, use a plastic bin, or wooden crate, and fill it with thick blankets or a sleeping bag, leaving a deep well in the center. Insert the pot in the well and cover with more blankets. The pot will stay warm for hours.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s also possible to cook rice in a thermos, by simply pouring hot water over it and leaving it slow cook.</p>
