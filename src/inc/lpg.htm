<p>In our {galley}, we use LPG (Liquefied petroleum gas) to cook by way of a gimballed stove.</p>

<p>The stove is fueled by a 5 kg (11 lbs) tank. {Pino} houses two tanks with only one tank connected at a time, this way we can get a tank filled while the other is still in use. One 5 kg tank can last us two months, and less if we bake a lot.</p>

<p>We used to carry a 9 kg (20 lbs) tank which could last us 4-5 months, but had to recycle it in {Japan}. Many countries don't want to refill foreign tanks, especially if they have an aged appearance. Throughout our travels we had to give up 3 tanks, 1 in New Zealand and 2 in Japan.</p>
