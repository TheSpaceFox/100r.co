<p>In mid August 2017, we sailed to Tonga from {Niue}, and stayed for 2 1/2 months. We spent most of our time tucked into Port Maurelle, a bay sheltered from most directions that is perfect for swimming.</p>

<p>We saw many wonderful sea creatures here, like octopus, sea turtles, cuttlefish, needle fish, rainbow fish etc. Devine liked to swim in the deeps, and was able to dive down to 9 m (30 ft) with just a snorkle mask. We dropped a towel once, it settled in the sand underneath Pino and Devine was able to retrieve it. Rekka is a long-distance surface swimmer, and would circle the entire bay almost every day. We liked to play catch on the beach, and cartwheeling in the shallows.</p>

<p>Port Maurelle had no services, if we wanted to get food we had to sail to Neiafu.</p>

<p>We liked to buy raw shelled peanuts to roast ourselves.</p>

<p>While there, we worked on {Markl}. Pino's next stop after Tonga was {New Zealand}.</p>
