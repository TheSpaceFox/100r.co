<p>We create our own tools, built light to reduce our energy use, also to lessen our dependence on closed-source applications we can't repair ourselves.</p>

<p>The reason we did this, is because we want to ensure that users — us included — have access to these tools no matter what. We want our ecosystem of tools to be...</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lightweight and simple.</li>
    <li>Always up-to-date.</li>
    <li>Usable across all platforms.</li>
    <li>Offline-first.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2016, whilst sailing, we experienced frequent failures with both our software and hardware (see {tools ecosystem}), due to our small {energy} storage and our lack of connectivity. The solution was to create our own tools so that we could repair them ourselves. The first version was an Electron App. Our focus was on replacing the software we were using to do creative work, like Photoshop, Xcode and Ableton.</p> 

<p>Building our own tools and using them {off the grid} made us realize how bloated, and power-hungry software can be. Our new focus was to find ways to further reduce energy use.</p>

<p>In 2019, we stopped using Electron. To ensure that users could continue to use our software across all platforms without using Electron, we opted to make web versions (that work offline). The web versions were temporary stand-ins, while we researched ways to build resilient software. Our research led us to create versions written in ANSI C using <a href='https://wiki.libsdl.org/' target='_blank'>SDL</a>, but again we found problems with it. In 2021, with longtermism in mind, we decided that the solution was to make our own portable 8-bit VM {Uxn}.</p>

<p>This is where we are now. Uxn solves our cross-platform issues, works without dependencies and is very, very light. It took us a long while to get here, we hope that one day the Uxn versions of our software replace the desktop and web versions [16.05.21].</p>
