<p>We create our own tools, built light to reduce our energy use, also to lessen our dependence on closed-source applications we can't repair ourselves.</p>

<p>The reason we did this, is because we want to ensure that users — us included — have access to these tools no matter what. We want our ecosystem of tools to be...</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lightweight and simple.</li>
    <li>Always up-to-date.</li>
    <li>Usable across all platforms.</li>
    <li>Offline-first.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 2016, whilst sailing, we experienced frequent failures with both our software and hardware (see {tools ecosystem}), due to our small {energy} storage and our lack of connectivity. The solution was to create our own tools. The first versions were Electron App. Our focus was to replace all the closed-source software we were using to do creative work, like Photoshop, Xcode and Ableton.</p> 

<p>Building our own tools and using them {off the grid} made us realize how bloated, and power-hungry software can be. Our new focus was to optimize our new tools to further reduce energy use, and to ensure reliability by removing all dependencies.</p>

<p>In 2019, we stopped using Electron. To ensure that users could continue to use our software across all platforms, we developed web versions (that could also work offline). The web versions were always meant as temporary stand-ins while we researched ways to build more resilient, cross-platform software—no easy task. We experimented with versions written in ANSI C using <a href='https://wiki.libsdl.org/' target='_blank'>SDL</a>, but again we found problems with this. The rabbits soldiered on. In 2020 we started learning Assembly(see {donsol}), and in 2021 we took a big step toward longtermism in software with {Uxn}, a portable 8-bit virtual machine.</p>

<p>This is where we are now. Uxn solves our cross-platform issues, works without dependencies and is very, very light. It took us a long while to get here, we hope that one day the Uxn versions of our software replace the desktop and web versions [16.05.21].</p>
