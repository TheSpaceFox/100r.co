<p>We keep a set of oars aboard {Pino}, they are 4.5m (15 ft) long, made from Sitka Spruce and laminated with TITEBOND 3 glue. They are designed to collapse in two and connect by way of an aluminum sleeve. These oars are typically commissioned, and used by the Canadian Coastguard. We have two beefy brass oar locks that we plan to affix to the boat.</p>

<h3>Why oars?</h3>

<p>Inspired by the engine-less propulsion techniques employed by sailors of <a href='https://r2ak.com/' target='_blank'>The Race to Alaska</a>, we got ourselves a pair of oars. The goal or having oars is to keep us moving on windless days, without having to rely entirely on our combustion engine. We don't know how much speed we can do, as we haven't installed them yet. We will report back with this information soon.</p>

<p>The goal of rowing a sailboat is not speed or efficiency. It does not replace an inboard engine, but it is a simple, and timeless way of keeping a vessel moving when there is no weather, or current. It's also a great way to combat restlessness.</p>

<h3>Stern-sculling vs sculling with 2 oars</h3>

<p>Our first idea was to installing an oar mounted at the stern (<a href='https://farreachvoyages.net/2019/08/13/sculling-an-18000-lb-boat-yes-you-can/' target='_blank'>stern sculling</a>), which we'd use to propel the boat with side-to-side movements that create forward lift in the water.</p>

<p>We spoke to the owner of <a href='http://www.barkleysoundoar.com/' target='_blank'>Barkley Sound Oar and Paddle</a> about our plans. He had built oars for boats in the R2AK in the past, and suggested sculling with two oars instead of one. We saw the start of the R2AK in 2016 in Victoria. There were boats propelled by two oars, and others with a stern-mounted oar. The ones propelled by two oars had better forward motion.</p>

<p>Entranced with the idea, we asked him if we could commission some long oars. He told us he no longer made them because it wasn't economically viable... BUT, he had ONE such pair left in his shop. He kept those oars for himself to use on a boat, but never did, and offered to sell them to us. We were very, very lucky to get a pair.</p>

<p>We plan to install stretchy lines from the mast to the oars, to make it easier to row. The lines would help with forward pulling.</p>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>

<p>The idea of a rowing a sailboat was inspired by the racers <a href='https://youtu.be/EmQnN5fwPLk' target='_blank'>R2AK</a>, but also by <a href='https://youtu.be/6LDltfO3fI8' target='_blank'>How to Sail Oceans</a> and <a href='https://farreachvoyages.net/2019/08/13/sculling-an-18000-lb-boat-yes-you-can/' target='_blank'>Far Reach Voyages</a> and this <a href='https://youtu.be/4cwO75R9Y4U' target='_blank'>awesome anonymous fellow</a>.</p>
