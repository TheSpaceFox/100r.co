<p>Inspecting our running rigging is part of our yearly {maintenance} schedule. We looked at our metal to rope jib halyard and found that the end was very damaged. The halyard was long that we could cut out the bad part and still have enough.</p>

<p>We thought of replacing it with a rope halyard, but realized that this would mean replacing the sheave at the top of the mast, so we quickly abandoned that idea.</p>

<p>Doing this means having to re-swage the end. Doing it isn't hard, but having the right tool helps.</p>

<p>We cut the bad piece of wire off, borrowed a swage tool from Mr. Oka (marina harbourmaster) and re-did the end, using all new parts.</p>

<p>Swaging a new metal ferrule on was easy enough.</p>

<p>Easy peasy lemon squeezy.</p>
