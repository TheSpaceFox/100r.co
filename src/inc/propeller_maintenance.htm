<p>We hauled Pino out of the water with plans to replace the cutless bearing, and to replace the bellow on our PSS shaft seal. To get the cutless bearing off, removing the propeller from the shaft is necessary. It is also a good idea to remove the shaft entirely, but more on that later...</p>

<p>When we bought Pino, it came with a PYI Max Prop 2. "Max-Props are feathering propellers, so unlike folding propellers, Max-Props do not rely on centrifugal force to open. Instead, the Max-Prop relies on the torque from the shaft rotation acting on the differential type gear design in the body of the propeller."</p>

<p>A prop like this is more complex than a solid design, but if maintained it will work well for a long, long time. The prop has to be greased every year or so, we've cheated and left more time pass between greasing, but it did no harm that we could see. The prop has two hex bolts, which can be unscrewed and where a little 'grease nipple' can be inserted. A grease gun hooks onto the nipple, and pumps grease straight into the cavity housing all of the gears inside of the Max prop. PYI recommends using a <b>calcium sulfonate</b> grease, because it doesn't wash away as quickly as other alternatives. We've put other types of grease in there, but a boatyard neighbor had some left over grease from his Max Prop and let us use the right thing. Time will tell if this makes a difference.</p>

<p>The propeller has 6 screws on one side of the body, heldfast by small cotter pins. We cut the pins, and proceeded to taking the unit apart. The grease inside had a yukey greeny browney color, but all of the inside components seemed well lubricate and happy.</p>

<p>When taking a Max Prop apart, clean the grease away from the gears to try and read the numbers on both the fins, and the central gear. We didn't take note of ours, because we didn't know the numbers were there and what they were for. Either way, ours were concealed in grease.</p>

<p>Each Max Prop can be adjusted to a specific pitch, matching the reduction gear ratio of the engine powering it. The central gear has two symbols etched into its grooves, a symbol with one circle, and another with two. Both have to be lined up with letters etched onto the edge of the gears at the end of each blade. A Max prop that is set wrong will not perform well. When we did our engine swap in 2020 (see {engine rebuild}), we changed from a Yanmar2GM(13hp) to a used Yanmar2GM20F(16hp), but since the change was done while in the water we didn't get to adjust the pitch. We measured our propeller (from blade to blade). Ours was 15 inches across. This, plus the engine reduction ratio helps determine the correct pitch. We weren't sure how to determine the blade angle, even with all of that information, so we gave PYI a ring, and they helped us out! </p>

<p>The desired blade angle for Pino's prop is 22 degrees, with the following settings: <b>X -> N</b>, <b>Y -> D</b>, and <b>Y -> S</b>. We jotted the letters down for later, for reassembly. </p>

<p>We removed the two spinners halves, then the blades, the central gear, and all of the associated bits, until the hub was the only thing left on the shaft. Removing the hub requires the use of a puller. We don't own one, but luckily, someone in the yard rents them out. We used the puller, along with a few hits with a mallet, and the hub came right off.</p>

<p>By then, the PSS shaft seal was already de-coupled (easy enough), but the engine coupling needed a lot of convincing. The engine coupling and the shaft coupling are bound together by somekind of flexible cylinder, there to reduce vibrations. The shaft coupling is bolted to that. Because the engine was put it in 2021, the bolts had been undone and weren't too difficult to pry off, same for the bolt on the shaft inside the coupling, and for the set screw (although we have to take a nut off before we can unscrew it). The hard part, was getting the coupling to release the shaft.Devine used the shaft seal SS rotor to make a lever and apply pressure, while they forced a ratchet nut inside from the other side with the spacer method. With a lot of effort, it agreed to let go.</p>

<p>The next step was to try and pull the shaft out. Unfortunately, we realized that Pino was designed in a way that the shaft cannot exit from the stern. The end of the shaft is lined with the skeg, and we can't exactly remove that can we? We learned that the only way to remove it, was to do it from the boat, and that requires lifting the engine from its mounts (WHAT...!). Some boats can drop their rudder to remove it, or the shaft is misaligned with the rudder so it can be pulled... but not ours! It is a very common, and frustrating thing. Our cutless bearing was old, but maybe not worth tearing the engine out to replace it. To make matters worse, we had no time to build a tool to remove the bearing while on the shaft. Next time, we'll gather all of the necessary bits prior to hauling out, and do it ourselves. For now, we'll have to live with the old cutless bearing. </p>
