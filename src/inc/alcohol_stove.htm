<p>Alcohol is a good alternative to LPG. It is a simple stand alone system, without high-pressure lines, sniffers or tanks.</p>

<p>A non-pressurized alcohol stove performs just as well as LPG. The Origo stove model has either one, or two canisters, that each accommodate 1.2 L of fuel. Each canister lasts 1 week of regular usage, this includes 3 meals a day, plus coffee and tea in evenings.</p>

<p>We wanted to try using alcohol, so we found one for cheap in 2020 with plans to switch away from {lpg} if we enjoyed the experience, but we found that denatured alcohol was very hard and expensive to get in Canada. Not just this, most denatured alcohol was 50% ethanol (or less) with the remainder being made up of methanol and other burnable chemicals such as MEK and acetone, resulting it a less-than-deal burn.</p>

<p>Alternatives like methyl hydrate(methanol) were plentiful but very dangerous to handle. Methanol is absorbed through the skin, stomach, or lungs and much of it becomes formaldehyde in the body, which changes to formic acid in the liver. Formic acid can cause death or damage to the brain or optic nerve leading to blindness. Methyl hydrate and denatured alcohol come in plastic, or metal containers(pour badly and rust).</p>

<p>If you have access to affordable denatured alcohol or methylated spirits cooking with alcohol is great, but we could not make it work while in Canada.</p>
