<p><b>Foam Density</b>. A liveboard boat gets more use, which ought to be considered when choosing a foam density. Higher density foams(which have less air in them) are higher quality and last longer. <a href="https://www.sailrite.com/" target="_blank">Sailrite</a> recommends using a foam with a density of <b>1.13kg(2.5lbs) minimum</b>. They also recommend layering foams(glued together) with different firmness ratings, with a firmer foam at the bottom that acts as a sort of box spring, although more comfortable it does bring up the cost considerably.</p>

<p><b>Foam Thickness</b>. What thickness to choose depends on the available space(our saloon won't allow anything thicker than 4 inches) and your personal preference. Thickness varies from 2-15cm(1-6in).</p>

<p><b>Foam Material</b>. Commonly memory foam is made from polyurethane, but some people choose Latex(especially for bedding) because of its durability and its antimicrobial properties. Memory foam is cheap, but Latex is costly.</p>
