<p>We visited Saturna Island in the Gulf Islands for the first time on August 22nd 2021.</p>

<p>We sailed into Plumper Sound and turned right to Lyall Harbour, where we dropped the hook. We expected to stay here a day, or two, but we ended up staying a full week. The bay is well protected from summer winds, although if a wind is blowing from directly sound it does accelerate in the hulls and it can get pretty gusty (not as much as Boot Cove though). </p>

<p>The depth in this bay is perfect, ranging from 15-25 feet in mud. There was no one around most times so we could set a good scope without worrying. Most boats preferred anchoring near the public dock at the head of the bay. The ferry comes and goes often, but the wake isn't too crazy when anchored further into the bay.</p>

<p>We only went on land once to the Saturna Lighthouse Pub to meet a friend. The pub has a great view of Plumper Sound.</p>

<p>In evenings, we rowed around the bay with {Teapot}.</p>
