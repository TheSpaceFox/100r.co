<p>The above is an atrocity we found in Pino's ceiling while re-doing the wiring. This is how a previous owner spliced some of the cabin lights together. This splice was tinned, covered in loose heat-shrink sleeve and bound by electrical tape, everything about this connection is bad.</p>

<q>The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at and repair. <br>— Douglas Adams</q>

<p><b>List of connection DONT's</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Never tape over connections</li>
<li>Never solder wires together, they ought to be mechanically connected</li>
<li>Never twist wires together</li>
<li>Never connect wires together with household "wire nuts"</li>
<li>Never wrap a bare wire around a terminal screw to connect wires together</li>
</ul>

<p><b>List of connection DO's</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Use terminals that are made from tin plated copper not aluminum</li>
<li>Use only plastic, not metal, clips to secure the wiring</li>
<li>Use ring terminals over spade terminals, ring terminal can't pull off</li>
<li>After crimping, always do a pull test(to make sure it won't come apart)</li>
<li>Always cover crimped connections with heat-actived, adhesive-lined heat shrink tubing</li>
<li>Use a heat gun for uniform heat-shrinking, an open flame will lead to uneven melting of the adhesive, distortions in the insulation and can lead to leaks, bubbles & voids</li>
<li>Use a good quality crimper that can double crimp</li>
</ul>

<p>Do your hands a favor, get/borrow good tools. Pino has a shitty wire stripper that destroys all it touches, including our fingers. A friend lent us his Ancor crimp tool.</p>

<p>Ring connectors are sized to wires, and are color-coded for each gauge size:</p>

<p><b>Pink</b> - 22-18 AWG<br>
<b>Yellow</b> - 12-10 AWG<br>
<b>Blue</b> - 16-14 AWG</p>

<p><b>Using butt connectors to splice wires?</b> We've been splicing wires together with butt connectors for a while now, but we've recently learned that it is bad practice. We do it anyway, because sometimes it is not possible to use a terminal block, but we figured it was a good idea to mention it here. We did it when connecting our manual switch for the bilge pump (more on that below).</p>

<q>Splicing circuits should be avoided. If splicing is necessary, it should employ a proper terminal block, and not butt connectors. Every splice in a circuit creates additional resistance, and the potential for the connection to come apart.<br>— David H. Pascoe, Marine Surveyor</q>

<p>Using terminal blocks when splicing wires seems to be the way to go.</p>
