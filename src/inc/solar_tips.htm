<h3>Solar installation</h3>

<p>When installation solar panels, on a 12V system you want them to be connected in parallel so the voltage stays the same, and so the amperage of each panel is added up. Two panels connected in parallel will connect to a 3-way T-type mc4 connector. This connector brings the sets of positive and negative wires and combines them into one, so they can be connected to the solar controller.</p>

<p>If the controller doesn't go through a breaker panel, adding a fuse between the solar panel and the controller, and between the controller and the battery is necessary. Fuses are sacrificial and protect your electrical components from damages caused by overcurrent.</p>
