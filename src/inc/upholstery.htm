<p>Cushions make up a large portion of a sailboat, the v-berth, saloon and quarter berths are covered in cushions. When they start to deterioriate the space becomes less pleasant to live in, and if the foam and fabric are especially old, molds and dust mites can be a problem.</p>

<p>See our upholstery projects:</p>

</ul>

<p>Replacing cushions and covers yourself is hard work, but learning to do it, getting a good sewing machine, is still cheaper than asking someone else to do it, and then you walk away with new skills and tools to do many more projects.</p>

<p>What foam and fabric to get?</p>

<h2><a id='buying'>Buying Fabric</a></h2>

<p>Measure all of the cushions onboard the boat. Take note of the width of your desired fabric, the length will depend on how much fabric is needed for the project (boxings, top plates and bottom plates). To find out how much fabric to buy use <a href="https://www.fabric-calculator.com/main-menu.aspx">Sailrite's Fabric Calculator</a>. Keep in mind that if pattern direction is important, you'll have to orient the cushions in the same direction when measuring the amount of fabric you'll need.</p>

<h2><a id='cutting'>Cutting Foam</a></h2>

<p>Foam stores use a foam-cutting tool that is a bit expensive to consider (unless you make a business of it), others use hot knives.</p>

<p>It is possible to use a bread knife with a serrated blade, although there is a special technique used to get clean cuts, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xne0qjhFVNY" target="_blank">this video</a> on how to do it.</p>

<p>It's also possible to use <a href="https://youtu.be/rGOxj22mkOw?si=nWJEIrZ4vNN-jtgr" target="_blank">hacksaw blades</a> to do it.</p>

<p>It is difficult for us to recommend a tool because we have not had to cut foam ourselves yet(we kept a lot of our existing foam, so far), but we thought we'd mention what we found during our research. We will have to cut foam someday and we'll update this bit to say what works best.</p>
