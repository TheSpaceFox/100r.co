<p><b>2024.01.19<br>Victoria, BC</b>.</p>

<p>We have been living without {refrigeration} since 2016, and have since kept our produce in open bins that we store in the v-berth. {Pino} has an icebox, but access is difficult, and the space is deep and stuffy. This space has instead housed large containers of condiments and oils, and these now share the space with jars of lacto-fermented goods.</p>

<p><b>Why an open pantry?</b> We liked the idea of an open pantry because it is easier to keep track of what produce we have. We see the bins and their contents everyday, and use up the more perishable items(greens) first. The pantry ought to have gaps to permit air to circulate.</p>

<p>We found that two bins is enough to store our produce. The top bin is for most vegetables, the bottom one is for potatoes and onions. We keep etylene-producing fruits(like applies and banana) separate, storing them in hanging bags in other parts of the boat. We sometimes store more perishable items under our sink, in an insulated space which can get very cold in the winter/spring/fall (we can keep 1L of soymilk there without it going bad).</p>

<h3>Building the shelves</h3>

<p>The two white bins in the above photo hold our produce, they're just leaning there, but give a good idea of what it's going to look like. It'll be nice to have the produce near the galley again!</p>

<p>We bought a length of pine meant for shelving and used a circular saw(borrowed from a friend, thanks Peter!) to cut it into 4. Two will serve as shelves, the other two will support the {gimballed stove}. Pine is very light, so we stained the wood with {coffee} to help darken the grain, and applied varnish-to strengthen them, to protect them from humidity and to make them easier to clean.</p>

<p>It's still cold outside, but we make use of sunny days to do work on the dock.</p>

<p>The back of the shelves have a lip on one side to keep the pots from sliding out when the boat is heeled over. The front will have a horizontal bar, secured by two hardwood U blocks. The two U blocks will be bolted(x3) to the walls. A lot of the shelves on the boat use this same design to keep objects in place.</p>

<p>The above horizontal bar is an off-cut used to test the blocks, the actual bars will be much longer than this but this photo gives a good preview of what we are attempting to do.</p>

<p>The U in the blocks were carved using a handsaw, a drill and a round file. We used the handsaw to cut two parallel(ish) lines to accommodate the width of the horizontal bar, then drilled a hole in the bottom of the U to help shave away some material(using the fattest drill bit we had), and then removed some of the left-over material with the round file. A chisel would work well, but we don't have one.</p>

<p>We carry a lot of small lengths of hard wood that are ideal for projects like this, wood that we've accumulated over the years, found on marina shelves, gifted by friends, bought at used marineware stores etc. We made the blocks out of some short lengths of teak.</p>

<p>When we were docked in Minamiise in {Japan}, (see {a home for pino}), the local yatch club were re-doing the docks out of some exotic hardwood and so we inherited a lot of small offcuts from them (they were throwing them away). The grain is a dark brown and we think it's from Central/South America, it might be Ipe or Tropical Walnut.</p>

<p>This is what the final shelves look like! The top basket holds produce like carrots, greens, and brussel sprouts, the lower basket houses potatoes and onions.</p>

<p>The gap on the side will act as storage for various cookware.</p>
