<p>Our galley is small, but has enough room for two people to cook. We have a 3-burner gimballed stove, equipped with a large oven. Since Pino has no {refrigeration}, we go out shopping for fresh food almost everyday.</p>

<p>Our sink is equipped with a brass fynspray hand pump. The pump came off an old boat, and was sold to us at a very good price. We were looking for a durable replacement to our baby foot pump, it was leaking badly and the new models did not fit our pedal. The hand pump doesn't draw out too much water, and looks very good.</p>

<p>We use our old ice box as a space for bulk containers of liquids, like big 5 L (1.3 US gal) bottles of olive oil, soy sauce, roasted sesame oil, apple cider vinegar, white vinegar etc.</p>
