<p>Our galley is small, but has enough room for two people to cook. We use a single burner {gimballed stove}. Since Pino has no {refrigeration}, we go out shopping for fresh food almost everyday, see our {open pantry}. When connected to shore power we use an <a href="../site/induction_cooking.html">induction plate</a> to <a href="../site/saving_fuel.html">save on fuel</a>.</p>

<p>We use our old ice box as a space for bulk containers of liquids, like big 5 L (1.3 US gal) bottles of olive oil, soy sauce, roasted sesame oil, apple cider vinegar, white vinegar etc.</p>
