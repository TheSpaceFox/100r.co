<p>As of June 26th 2021, we are still in the process of building our dry toilet. See our {dry toilet installation timeline} for details.</p>

<h3>Liquids</h3>

<p>For the liquids, we calculated that for two people for a full week, we would need a 31 L tank. Of course, some days we don't urinate as much as other days, but that tank would allow for that odd week where we exceed normal amounts. We visited Industrial Plastics and Paints in Victoria and found a 27 L (6 CDN Gal) polyethylene tank. Polyethylene tanks are generally less prone to retaining odors and is CSA Certified to NSF/ANSI 61. It is smaller than we had planned, but because we overcalculated the first amount we think that this will work out fine. We had them put a fitting overtop so we can close the tank while underway.</p>

<p>To empty the tank, we'll connect a foot pump to it to transfer it into a smaller 5 L carry container to dump in a public toilet, or in the sea when far from shore. When underway, we might just get a long hose and pump it directly overboard from the forward hatch, we are not sure yet. We could have kept a thru-hull to empty it out, but preferred to close it.</p>

<p>We bought a Forian porcelain urine diverter by <a href='https://urineseparator.com/' target='_blank'>Shit and Blossoms</a> to keep the liquids and solids separate. We chose porcelain because of its durable and hygienic properties. Very few companies offer the option of a porcelain separator, it is easy to clean and will last for a long, long time.</p>

<p>We've been living without a holding tank for some time, and were carrying around a sturdy 5 L jug to use while in marinas or busy harbors. We kept a funnel to help our aim (or rather, Rekka's aim). We would dump its contents in a public toilet once a day, depending on usage. All urine has an odor, and we do smell it when emptying the bottle, and the big liquids tank will be no different. With the jug, we would keep a spray bottle with a 1:1 vinegar mix to spray in the funnel after use. It helps to break up accumulations, as well as smells. For odors that persist, 1 tablespoon of raw sugar or a few ounces of vinegar to the tank (or jug) will reduce this odor.</p>

<h3>Solids</h3>

<p>For solids, we got a 20 L polyethylene tank with a cover (to close it in rough waters), usually used to store batteries. We don't know how often we'll have to empty it yet. For now, we plan to use wood chips sourced cheaply (because we weren't filling a truck-load, they sometimes give it to us for free) from a landscaping company in Victoria. A general rule is to ensure the ratio of medium to human waste is 1:1. We keep the medium in a bag with a scoop. In the winter, we think we may be able to use ash from the {woodstove} as a medium (we hope).</p>

<p>When the container gets about 3/4 full, we'll have to empty it. Ideally, we'd like to find someone to team up with on land to make a humanure composting pile.</p>

<p>Future Notes: adding diatomaceous earth to the compost will kill and deter insect infestation. The Diatomaceous Earth can be purchased at swimming pool supply stores, Lowes, Home Depot, etc.</p>
