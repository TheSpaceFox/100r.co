<p>As of June 26th 2021, we are still in the process of building our dry toilet. The first step was to remove the old raw water head, piping and the {thruhulls}.</p>

<h3>Liquids</h3>

<p>For the liquids, we calculated that for two people for a full week, we would need a 31 L tank. Of course, some days we don't urinate as much as other days, but that tank would allow for that odd week where we exceed normal amounts. We visited Industrial Plastics and Paints in Victoria and found a 27 L (6 CDN Gal) tank. It is smaller than we had planned, but because we overcalculated the first amount we think that this will work out fine. We had them put a fitting overtop so we can close the tank while underway.</p>

<p>To empty the tank, we'll connect a foot pump to it to transfer it into a smaller 5 L carry container to dump in a public toilet, or in the sea when far from shore. When underway, we might just get a long hose and pump it directly overboard from the forward hatch, we are not sure yet. We could have kept a thru-hull to empty it out, but preferred to close it.</p>

<p>We bought a Forian porcelain urine diverter by <a href='https://urineseparator.com/' target='_blank'>Shit and Blossoms</a> to keep the liquids and solids separate. We chose porcelain because of its durable and hygienic properties. Very few companies offer the option of a porcelain separator, it is easy to clean and will last for a long, long time. We were hesitant to buy a new product, we try to minimize the purchase of new anything as much as possible, but because it is durable, and handmade by a small company we thought it okay, for once.</p>

<h3>Solids</h3>

<p>For solids, we got a 20 L tank with a cover (to close it in rough waters). We don't know how often we'll have to empty it yet. For now, we plan to use wood chips sourced cheaply (because we weren't filling a truck-load, they sometimes give it to us for free) from a landscaping company in Victoria. A general rule is to ensure the ratio of medium to human waste is 1:1. We keep the medium in a bag with a scoop. In the winter, we think we may be able to use ash from the {woodstove} as a medium.</p>

<p>When the container gets about 3/4 full, we'll have to empty it. Ideally, we'd like to find someone to team up with on land to make a humanure composting pile.</p>


<h3>Timeline</h3>

<p>10.04-21 Purchased urine separator from Shit and Blossoms.</p>
<p>04-06-21 Removed {thruhulls}, macerator, marine head and piping.</p>
<img src='../media/content/compostinghead/03.jpg' loading='lazy' title='hole in floor to accomodate liquids tank' />
<p>05-06-21 Cut hole in floor for the liquids tank to fit into. If we did not make a hole, the toilet would be too high for us to sit on. There was already a hole there, to give access to the now gone head thru-hulls. We removed the door, with plans to re-use it, and enlargened it.</p>
<p>06-06-21 We fibreglassed (and painted) some supports on the sides of the hole to level liquids tank. If the tank sits on the bottom, it is crooked and may squish some of the hoses running underneath.</p>

<p>10-06-21 A vent is important on a dry toilet, because it helps to dry out the solids, removing smells, hastening composting and discouraging insects. Our head used to have a solar vent, but it could not be closed. On boisterious passages, we often had salt water coming inside, and eventually, it killed the fan. So, we removed it, but it took us a long time to find an affordable and suitable replacement. While in {Japan}, we temporarily put a used deckplate to plug the hole, but it too was leaky. We found a Vetus SS mushroom vent online this year, it looked immaculate, and more importantly it was sold for cheap (got it for 40$CAD). This vent has a green water shut off, ideal when underway. It's diameter was smaller than the hole we already had, so we had to reduce its size. We cut ring out of plywood, sized to the hole, placed it into the hole, glassed it in, painted it and then drilled 5 small holes for the vent. We added butyl tape (bed-it) between the deck and the vent base. Goal is to route a pipe to that to a fan, opening onto the solids tank. With a fan, the contents of the toilet will shrink rapidly, allowing much greater capacity.</p>

<p>16-06-21 Working on some of the structural woodwork for the installation. The head has a very weird shape, it narrows in two directions. We did many back and forths between workshop and the boat to get all the pieces to fit right. We used plywood from other projects, and found many useful bits from a discard bin in the workshop (even some pieces of teak!). We separated both the liquids and solids tank with a board, to provide stability, and added a board in the front (also for stability). We needed to build something that can take our weight, and that can withstand the constant motion that a boat is subject to.</p>
<p>18-06-21 We added three coats of instant {coffee} staining, and 1 coat of epoxy on all pieces of wood. We sanded the result lightly before adding the epoxy.</p>

<p>20-06-21 Trying to do the Shinto thing and building the whole thing without using nails or screws, using dowels. Using less metal on a boat is better anyway.</p>

<img src='../media/content/compostinghead/08.jpg' loading='lazy' title='tadaaaa, not done, but close. Re-using the seat from our old marine head' />
<p>25-06-21 We placed the seat from our old marine head onto the board to test it out, and to draw the hole we would have to make. We drew the outline of the circle, with a 1.27 cm (1/2 in) of extra padding. We did not want the hole under the seat to line up perfect with it (to avoid messy accidents). We cut a hole in the lid with a jigsaw, epoxied it (hanging helps to coat all sides on the same day). We chose a very bad day to do epoxy. It was 34 C outside, too hot to do this sort of work, and the mixture would solidify way too quickly. We wasted a lot of resin and hardener because of this. We had to make 3 half batches to finish the lid, and each time it was a race against time, against the inevitable chemical reaction, trying to finish the work before the mixture would be rendered unusable. In the end, we had 3 containers with 3 shallow pools of hardened epoxy... what a waste. We could have waited, but this week the temperature is going to be far worse (forecast is for 38 C in two days). We would hate to imagine how quickly a resin and hardener mix would set at such a temperature.</p>
<p>Still not finished... more steps to come.</p>
