<p>Meet <b>Lefbit</b>, the mascot for Left. Lefbit is there to talk about updates relating to Left.</p>

{/story}

<h2 id='distributions'>Distributions</h2>

<p>The first version of Left was released on <a href='https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/left' target='_blank'>itch.io</a> for desktop in 2017.</p>

<p>We have since released many more versions of Left. A <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Left' target='_blank'>web version</a> was initially created to help Rekka with the writing of {Wiktopher}, and later rewritten as a lightweight <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/left' target='_blank'>SDL graphical text editor</a>. The web version features an auto-complete, synonyms suggestions, writing statistics, markup-based navigation and a speed-reader. These features will hopefully make their way into the new version.</p>

<p>There is also an even lighter, <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/left' target='_blank'>Uxn version</a> in the works, written in <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal.html' target='_blank'>Uxntal</a>.</p>

<p>What is {uxn}?</p>

<h2 id='tutorial'>tutorial</h2>
<p>Launch the app. You'll see a <b>main window</b>, as well as a <b>sidebar</b> on the left. You'll be writing in the main window, the sidebar will list all of the <b>markers</b> and <b>separate files</b> that you create.</p>
<p>The app opens with a <b>splash</b>, listing a guide as well as a list of shortcuts. At the bottom left of the main window, there are numbers followed by letters:</p>
<ul>
    <li>L stands for lines</li>
    <li>W for words</li>
    <li>V for vocabulary</li>
    <li>C for character.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you write, these numbers will increase and you'll know exactly how many lines, words, characters and unique words there are in your text. These stats are followed by a <b>percentage</b> to show you where you are in the text, with 0% indicating the beginning, and 100% the end - this is useful when writing large texts.</p>

<h2 id='creating_a_new_file'>creating a new file</h2>
<p>Create a new file with <b>⌘ n</b> (most of the shorts using 'command' combined with a letter or other character).</p>
<p>The main window will now be empty. If you look on the sidebar you will see the <b>splash</b> listed, you can return to it by selecting it or by using <b>⌘ ]</b> and <b>⌘ [</b>.</p>
<p>The file you created, by default is named 'untitled', you can rename it by saving the file using <b>⌘ n</b>.</p>

<h2 id='writing'>writing</h2>
<p>To better organize your text, you can create markers by beginning lines with:</p>
<p><b>#</b> or <b>##</b></p>
<p>Using these will list them on the sidebar in different ways.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>#</b> will create a main header.</li>
    <li><b>##</b> will create a sub-header.</li>
</ul>
<p>The markers will be listed under your document name on the side bar, and whichever other document that you create will be listed underneath everything.</p>
<p>Once you have more than one marker, you can cycle through them using <b>⌘ ]</b>.</p>
