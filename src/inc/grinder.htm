<p>Aboard Pino we use a second hand Molino Corona mill to grind whole grains into flour. It is hand-powered, similar to a meat grinder, except that the unit is larger with metallic burrs. We've wanted one ever since we read Sailing the Farm by Kenneth Neumeyer. While in Fiji, our good friends from the sailboat <a href='https://www.muktuk.de/' target='_blank'>Muktuk</a> had one to grind their wheat berries to make fresh bread.</p>

<p>Whole wheat flour doesn't have a long shelf life because it still has the germ, its oils oxidize and turn rancid. Keeping whole wheat berries and grinding them as needed ensures that the flour is fresh when you need it.</p>

<p>Whole grains last a long, long time, provided they're in a dry, and semi-shaded environment.</p>

<p>With a mill it's possible to grind barley, buckwheat, soy beans, chickpeas, oat, rice, corn etc.</p>
