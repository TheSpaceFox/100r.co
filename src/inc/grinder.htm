<p>Aboard Pino we use a second hand Molino Corona mill to grind whole grains into flour. It is hand-powered, similar to a meat grinder, except that the unit is larger with metallic burrs. We've wanted one ever since we read Sailing the Farm by Kenneth Neumeyer. While in Fiji, our good friends from the sailboat <a href='https://www.muktuk.de/' target='_blank'>Muktuk</a> had one to grind their wheat berries to make fresh bread.</p>

<p>Whole wheat flour doesn't have a long shelf life because it still has the germ, its oils oxidize and turn rancid. Keeping whole wheat berries and grinding them as needed ensures that the flour is fresh when you need it.</p>

<p>Whole grains last a long, long time, provided they're in a dry, and semi-shaded environment.</p>

<p>With a mill it's possible to grind barley, buckwheat, soy beans, chickpeas, oat, rice, corn etc.</p>

<p>We also carry an old fashioned food processor (meat grinder) on board. They're easy to find in thrift stores, and generally cost anywhere from 10-15$. It has quickly become one of our favorite {galley tools}.</p>

<p>We first decided to get one to process peanuts into peanut butter, and to process wheat berries into a mush to bake bread.</p>

<p>We have since found that it works well to grind soybeans to make soy milk. They are easy to take apart and clean, but the metal discs should be coated with vegetable oil after every use, otherwise they will rust.</p>

<p>We also like to use a simple potato masher to make hummus, cooked beans are easy to squish by hand.</p>
