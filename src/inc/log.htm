<h3>News</h3>

<p>On February 14th, we celebrated our 7th year living aboard our beloved {Pino}. It's also around this time 10 years ago that we were still living in Odaiba(Japan), and beginning our work on what would be our first game collaboration: {Oquonie}.</p>

<p>The {uxn} port of Oquonie has advanced in incredible leaps this month. Rek has finished re-doing all of the assets. Devine is now working on the music, and finalizing some of the levels. We are testing the game as we go, and hope to release it sometime next month. Oquonie will be playable on a number of platforms, including the <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/109887931570318719' target='_blank'>Nintendo DS</a>(Mastodon), as well as the <a href='../media/content/stream/2023_oquonie.jpg' target='_blank'>Playdate</a>. See a small <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/109904081987266827' target='_blank'>preview</a>(Mastodon).</p>

<p>Early next month we are traveling to Galiano Island in the Salish Sea for <a href='https://activepassive.ca/index.html' target='_blank'>BioSonic</a>(by ActivePassive). We'll be part of an event series exploring the intersections of music, art and biodiversity. We'll give a talk on March 10th, and Devine will perform with {Orca} on the 11th at the Galiano South Hall.</p>

<h3>News</h3>

<p>This month, we started porting {Oquonie} to {Uxn}. This is a long time coming, but we weren't sure if it was possible to do, and we still had a lot to learn before even thinking of taking it on. Now, we think we are ready. We are <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/109753175335217737' target='_blank'>re-drawing the sprites</a>(Mastodon), and they look amazing. This is an important test for us, and for Uxn.</p>

<p>Here is a very adorable <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/109689586631044117' target='_blank'>little Uxn sprite</a> for Potato that comes up when a rom path was mistyped, see it also on the {uxn} page.</p>
