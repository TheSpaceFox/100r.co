    <li><b>{Oquonie}</b>, released the game for Uxn. We have a <a href='https://merveilles.town/@voxel/110189746091696167' target='_blank'>Windows95+ compatible version</a>[Mastodon video].</li>
	<li><b>{Left}</b>, various UX improvements, including negative length selection.</li>
	<li><b>Note Pad</b>, ported the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp6io-G6dQQ' target='_blank'>classic macintosh Note Pad</a>(YouTube) application to Varvara, download it <a href='https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn-utils/tree/main/item/gui/notepad/notepad.tal' target='_blank'>here</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>{Oquonie} is out and it is playable! A big thank you to those who helped us test the game on a variety of devices and systems all the way to Windows95. This version of Oquonie differs a little from the original, in that some of the puzzles and secrets have changed. We hope that those who played the original will too enjoy this one. We have a special build of the game on <a href='https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/oquonie' target='_blank'>itchio</a> with the emulator and rom combined, if you have a false-negative virus warning on Windows 10, you will need to use the standard uxn32 emulator and rom.</p>

<p>We have watched as people implemented <a href='https://github.com/hundredrabbits/awesome-uxn' target='_blank'>their own emulators</a> and were able to play Oquonie on a Varvara of their own making. The current <a href='http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/varvara.html' target='_blank'>implementation documentation</a> might need to be improved, if you have feedback for things that could be clearer, please let us know!</p>

<p>We published our experiments with {solar cooking} this month, and wrote a more detailed post on {solar evacuated tube cooking}. The real test will happen this summer. We plan to keep a log of everything we cook, how long it takes, and the conditions(sun, overcast, temp etc).</p>

<p>We're still closing a few projects aboard {Pino}, to get it ready for some summer sailing. Our plans for now are loose, we're hauling the boat out of the water in early June, with plans to sail back towards Desolation Sound afterward, with a possible stop by Jervis Inlet.</p>

<h3>News</h3>

<p>On February 14th, we celebrated our 7th year living aboard our beloved {Pino}. It's also around this time 10 years ago that we were still living in Odaiba(Japan), and beginning our work on what would be our first game collaboration: {Oquonie}.</p>

<p>The {uxn} port of Oquonie has advanced in incredible leaps this month. Rek has finished re-doing all of the assets. Devine is now working on the music, and finalizing some of the levels. We are testing the game as we go, and hope to release it sometime next month. Oquonie will be playable on a number of platforms, including the <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/109887931570318719' target='_blank'>Nintendo DS</a>(Mastodon), as well as the <a href='../media/content/stream/2023_oquonie.jpg' target='_blank'>Playdate</a>. See a small <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/109904081987266827' target='_blank'>preview</a>(Mastodon).</p>

<p>Early next month we are traveling to Galiano Island in the Salish Sea for <a href='https://activepassive.ca/index.html' target='_blank'>BioSonic</a>(by ActivePassive). We'll be part of an event series exploring the intersections of music, art and biodiversity. We'll give a talk on March 10th, and Devine will perform with {Orca} on the 11th at the Galiano South Hall.</p>

<h3>News</h3>

<p>This month, we started porting {Oquonie} to {Uxn}. This is a long time coming, but we weren't sure if it was possible to do, and we still had a lot to learn before even thinking of taking it on. Now, we think we are ready. We are <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/109753175335217737' target='_blank'>re-drawing the sprites</a>(Mastodon), and they look amazing. This is an important test for us, and for Uxn.</p>

<p>Here is a very adorable <a href='https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/109689586631044117' target='_blank'>little Uxn sprite</a> for Potato that comes up when a rom path was mistyped, see it also on the {uxn} page.</p>
