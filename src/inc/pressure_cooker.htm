<p>Pressure cookers are cooking pots that are airtight, designed to allow pressure build-up inside. With heat the steam inside builds up beyond atmospheric pressure and rises beyond boiling points, able to reach temperatures of 110 degrees. Using a pressure cooker is an ideal way to cook food fast. Foods that require 60 minutes on the stovetop will take 10-15 minutes in a pressure cooker. We also like to use ours to do {insulation cooking}, combining these two techniques can save 80% of fuel.</p>
