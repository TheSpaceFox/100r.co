<p>Conserving fuel is a must on a boat, especially on long ocean passages. We experimented with this over the years, and have continued to use these techniques when near land. Conserving fuel is good practice, because most boats use fossil fuels, a finite and dirty resource, and because it saves money.</p>

<p>Using a pressure cooker is an ideal way to cook food fast. We like to use it to cook whole grains and legumes. Foods that require 60 minutes on the stovetop will take 10-15 minutes in a pressure cooker. We also like to use ours as an insulation cooker.</p>

<p>Insulation cooking involves bringing a dish to boil, turning the heat off, covering the dish with a lid, and placing in an insulated container. Over a period of time, the dish cooks by the heat captured in the insulated container. Cooking food this way brings fuel consumption down threefold. The only requirement is that the food must be prepared ahead of time, since the cooking time is longer. It is useful on a boat, when a meal is cooked once in the morning with it ready to eat later in the day, still hot.</p>

<p>We cook the food in cast iron cookware, cast iron keeps heat longer, and even longer when insulated. We then place the cast iron pot, or pan, in a bin filled with thick blankets or a sleeping bag. The pot/pan is covered, and will stay warm for hours.</p>

<p>We also like to put a dish cloth in our pressure cooker, and to place our cast iron pot in it. We drape the dish cloth overtop and then add the pressure cooker lid and block all air intake. Again, the pressure cooker helps keep the food warm. We have <a href='https://grimgrains.com/site/stovetop_blackberry_cake.html' target='_blank'>slow-baked cakes</a> like this, with much success.</p>
