<p>In late June, we sailed to Fiji and stayed for 4 months. The sail to Savusavu took 15 days from {New Zealand}, it was a slow ride because of contrary winds.</p>

<p>We experienced complete stillness on the ocean, for the first time.</p>

<p>We stayed in Savusavu for a while, comfortable in Nakama Creek. We had a fresh food market nearby, plenty of places to walk to, and easy access to kava. We liked eating out at Korean restaurant in town, that is, until we learned it was run by a homophobic doomsday cult.</p>

<p>Eventually, we moved down to Makogai, a former leper colony and island without a chief. Then, we hopped over to the tiny paradise island of {Leleuvia}, to wait for a window to move to Suva. We found protection in a small bay near Lami, not too far from downtown. We spent a week or so in Lami, enjoying the company of our neighbors.</p>

<p>Our next stop was Momi Bay, we used it as a stop-over before going to Malolo Lailai. The passage to this island is tricky, and dotted with reefs, it is best done when the sun is high. We brought our cycles on land and went around the dirt roads surrounding the island.</p>

<p>Our last stop in Fiji was Vuda Point Marina, where we stocked up for the passage north to the {Marshall Islands}. Pino was sandwiched between boats, bow tied to shore, and stern to a central mooring. Vuda Point Marina has a circular marina, with all of the boats sitting side to side, fender to fender. Getting on and off the boat was tricky at times...</p>

<p>Our favorite food there was taro root and passion fruit.</p>
