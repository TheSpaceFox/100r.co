<p>In late June, we sailed to Fiji and stayed for 4 months. The sail to Savusavu took 15 days from Opua, it was a slow ride because of contrary winds.</p>

<p>We experienced complete stillness on the ocena, for the first time.</p>

<p>We stayed in Savusavu for a while, before sailing down to Makogai, a former leper colony. Then, we hopped over to {Leleuvia}, to wait for a window to move to Suva. We stayed in a little anchorage far from downtown, a secluded area with moorings. Eventually, we left for an overnight sail to Momi Bay, to use as a stop-over before going to Malolo Lailai. Our last stop in Fiji was Vuda Point Marina, where we stocked up for the passage north to the {Marshall Islands}.</p>

<p>Our favorite food there was taro root and passion fruit.</p>
