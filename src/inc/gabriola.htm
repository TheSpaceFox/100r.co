<p>In 2016 we visited Silva Bay on Gabriola, using it as a stop over to jump to Vancouver. We did this again in September 2021. Leaving from Gabriola to cross the Strait of Georgia gives a good angle to the prevailing winds in the area, wether they're coming from the NW or SE. Leaving, or arriving there cuts the distance across considerably.</p>

<p>The only downside to this bay, is that it's filled with moorings. There is no room to anchor, at all... except maybe at the northern end of the bay, but that area is also more exposed. Moorings on this island are a real issue. Degnen Bay on the south end is too full of moorings. It is very unfortunate considering that this bay is a hurricane hole, perfect to weather storms... transients now have to skip it. We went inside to see if it was really as full as people said it was, and we found no room... except maybe one by the public dock, but mooring there would also mean blocking the path to vessels wishing to get on, or off the dock. Sigh.</p>

<p>We couldn't use Degnen Bay to wait for slack tide at Gabriola pass, but we did drop anchor for 2 hours in Cole's Bay, just west of the pass on the northern end of Valdes Island. It is... not ideal. There are structures that occupy most of the bay, and the area is highly affected by the currents from the pass. If waiting to enter from the other side, the anchorage off Kendrick island is better, and well-sheltered.</p>

<p>We stayed at the Page's Resort docks for a few days in late September, to wait for bad weather to pass. The rates are cheaper past September 7th (winter rates). This gave us ample time to explore the island. From the marina, Drumbeg Provincial Park is a short walk away, and it is a lovely, lovely place! On the way, there is a woodworking school with beautiful structures. We were looking for some medium for our {dry_toilet} and were glad that they agreed to part with some wood shavings.</p>

<p>The nearest grocery, Nester's Food Market, is an hour bike ride away, by way of the North road. There are a few difficult hills, but it's a nice ride overall. The road is busiest near the grocery, but safe to cycle through otherwise. There is also a BC liquor right next door. It's also possible to get to town by waving down Gertie, the community busy.</p>
