<p>On June 27th, we arrived in Hayathim Marine Park (previously Von Donop inlet) on Cortes Island. It was a 15 nm sail from Refuge Cove. We spent the night there at the dock to upload a video for our upcoming NIME talk. We were supposed to do the Keynote address live on July 1st, but we do not think we can find a reliable connection to stream with. To upload the video, we needed a good strong connection. The connection at other anchorages was fine for sending emails and other kinds of light uploads/downloads, but would never allow us to upload a 40 minute video.</p>

<p>We had planned on going to Squirrel Cove, just a short 2.3 nm sail across the channel, but after reading about sailors fouling their anchors on old engine blocks and logging equipement we decided to go elsewhere, especially with some south east winds in the forecast (it is well protected, but there is some chop in strong SE winds). There was some wind that day anyway, so we decided to try and sail to the north of Cortes Island.</p>

<p>The wind was forecast to be 10-15 knots from the NW, right on the nose. To get to the northern end of Cortes, it is necessary to pass through a long narrow channel (Lewis Channel), meaning that we would need to do a lot of tacks to get up there. Pino, with its deep draft and tall mast, sails very well into the wind, and so we decided to work our sailing muscles and to go for it. The wind was at 10-11 knots to start, nice and smooth, and the more we approached the mouth of the channel, the stronger the wind (accelerated through the channel). A sailboat was motoring behind us, and they were kind enough to get out of our way as we made short tacks back and forth.</p>

<p>Sailing this way is rather long, and exhausting, especially in 27 C weather and full sun. In the channel we saw clear-cut areas from logging, places that where never replenished with new trees. New growth on faraway hillsides is easy enough to see, the trees are greener, and draw a clear shape.</p>

<p>We arrived at the north of Cortes, and there the wind decided to stop and we motored the rest of the way. We assumed we would have better wind up there, it is difficult to ever have a guarantee of wind in places dotted with so many islands. The mouth of Hayathim Marine Park was just south of that point, where the entrance narrows and into the narrowest point is a rock, planted dead in the center and making all who pass near it sweat a whole lot. Because the inlet is big, there is a fair amount of current passing through this narrow, strong enough that we let the engine idle to let us carry us through, hugging the right side of the channel with the accursed rock on the port side of Pino. The water was high at that point, and we couldn't see any sign of the rock from the deck.</p>

<p>We found a spot in the southernmost bay, dropping the hook in 25 feet of water.</p>
