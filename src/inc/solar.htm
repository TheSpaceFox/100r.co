<p>We have 2x90W, hard, polycrystalline solar panels, purchased used in {New Zealand}.</p>

<p>We left Canada in 2016 with 2 flexis, an 80W and 100W, but the first suffered from corrosion and died (2018), and the second was lost in the {North Pacific Ocean} (2020) after we were hit by a large wave.</p>
