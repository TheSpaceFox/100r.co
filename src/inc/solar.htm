<p>We've experimented a lot with our solar setup, mostly due to equipement failure (corrosion) or complete loss (wave event). In all, we want to keep our solar panel setup small, because too many panels on deck is cumbersome.</p>

<p>We currently have one <b>90W</b> hard polycrystalline panel under the boom, and a flexible ETFE <b>100W</b> panel on the bimini top. We would have preferred to set up the two hard panels we had because they last longer, but they are heavy, and we could not find a way to safely (and cheaply) set up a second hard panel on Pino.</p>

<p>We use a <b>ProStar-15 Solar Controller</b>

<ul>
	<li>04.2016 Bought one 80W (in front of mast) and a 100W flexible panels (on bimini top)</li>
	<li>11.2017 80W panel connections corroded, dead. Moved 100W to dodger.</li> 
	<li>02.2018 Bought two used hard 90W polycrystalline panels, installed over bimini.</li>
	<li>09.2018 Too much weight aft, no panels on bimini.</li>
	<li>06.2020 Lost 100W flexi panel after wave event.</li> 
	<li>04.2021 Sold one of two hard 90W panel.</li>
	<li>06.2021 Bought and installed new 100W flexi panel on bimini.</li>
