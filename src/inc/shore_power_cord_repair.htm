<p>On a rainy summer day, we pulled into Silva bay on Gabriola Island and found a place at a dock to wait out a spell of bad weather. The power receptacle appeared fine, but once we were ready to leave we found the male connection of our shore power cord had melted. Two out of three prongs were stuck in the receptacle. We've never had issues with our cord before, and for now we assume that the marina shore connection was faulty. Either way, we had to repair the power cord.</p>

<p>We always prefer to repair than to replace, so when we returned to a place with a marine store, we got ourselves replacements connections, both male and female to replace the two damaged ends.</p>

<p>The cord itself was fine. We cut the old heads off with a pair of shears and saw that there was no damage inside. We then striped roughly 2 inches of the yellow covering to reveal the 3 wires tucked inside, a black, white and green (ground).</p>

<p>We stripped the cover off the ends of the 3 wires, then opened the new Marinco heads, removing the top screws and inserted the 3 wires in their corresponding slots, tightening the screws on the side to secure each wire.</p>

<p>If replacing a fitting with a weather covering overtop, it's important to feed the covering in first before securing the 3 wires.</p>

<p>Then, we slid the weatherproof cover overtop with the lock ring in place, and voila! Our power cord was as good as new.</p>
