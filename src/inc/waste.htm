<p>Waste is always a tricky topic for boaters, because it’s something you’ve got to deal with. Keeping surrounding waters clean and free of contaminants is important. The primary environmental concern with sewage is not the urine, which is sterile, but feces which contain bacteria, pathogens, and nutrients, and should not go overboard.</p>

<p>Most sailboats have marine heads that use either fresh, or salt water, and they can be powered, or make use of manual hand pumps to suck in water, and to evacuate sewage. Typically, the head is routed through a 3-way valve (Y valve) that can be switched to empty directly overboard by way of a thru-hull, or into a holding tank. A macerator lies between the tank and thru-hull, its job is to break up the sewage into tiny particles.</p>

<p>We don't recommend fresh water toilets on a boat. Flushing with fresh water accounts for nearly a third of household water consumption, and that doesn't make sense of a small space. All onboard tankage ought to be used for cooking, washing or drinking. Marine heads that use sea water are better, although they will require more maintenance.</p>

<p>A holding tank may only be emptied, from at least, 3 miles from shore. Pump-out stations will help you get rid of waste, but are only available near a handful of cities.</p>

<p>A {dry toilet} is a good option for those who do not want to haul anchor and head offshore to flush their tank. Having a dry toilet aboard frees up much-needed space. It also means no holding tank to empty, no smelly hoses to unclog, and little to no maintenance. You can build your own dry toilet or buy one of the many models on the market. On the market most dry toilets are referred to as 'composting heads' despite the fact that they are not designed for true, full composting onboard. Humanure needs 12-24 months to become pathogen free, and no sailboat has the carrying capacity for this (esp considering that a tank is emptied once a month, or once every 2-3 months depending on usage).

<q>The word waste doesn’t exist in nature. Waste is not a word fit for the 21st century and the ecological society we’re trying to build. We are the only animal that deliberately mixes water with our own waste. That’s important because you create such a treatment issue to clean that water up. It’s ecological insanity. — Fin Jordão</q>
