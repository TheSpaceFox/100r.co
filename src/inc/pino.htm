<p>We have 2 Solar Panels(2x90 W). For additional power, we carry a small portable generator as a backup to our solar. Our Hondaâ€™s 1,000-watt generator is compact, fuel-efficient, lightweight, and can run for 7.1 hours on 2.7 liters (0.7 US gal) of gas. Our boat has a 75 AMP Balmar alternator, but it is only used to charge the batteries on cloudy days. We consider these options as backups, as redundancy to our main source of power, solar.</p>

<p>We have a total of 464 Ah. Our flooded-cell battery banks consists of a series configured starter bank (2x6 Volt Cells) and a series-parallel configured house bank (2x6 V cells). Both sets are identical, equalling 12 V each. Because they're identical, we often use both as house banks.</p>

<p>We don't have a windlass, pressure faucet, water heater or a fridge. Because of this, it's easy to keep our power consumption low, reducing our need for extra solar, keeping our costs down and reducing the amount of things that can break, or fail.</p>

<p>Our main water tank carries 170 L (45 US gal), our secondary has 50 L (13 US gal), while an additional 100 L (26 US gal) is stored in jerry cans. When it is not possible to dock at a marina, we use smaller(4x10L|4x2.6 US gallons) jerry cans to ferry water from shore. While it requires more trips, the lighter containers are less prone to breakage.</p>

<p>We carry 3 anchors onboard. We have a Bruce 10 kg (22 lbs), and a Rocna 10 kg (22 lbs) and 15 kg (33 lbs). We carry 30.5 m (100 ft) of chain, with 61 m (200 ft) of 3-strand nylon.</p>
