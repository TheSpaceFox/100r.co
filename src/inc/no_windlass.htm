<p>We haul the anchor up by hand most times, but when anchored in thick mud or deeper waters we like to lead a line back to the cockpit and to use the above method to haul up the anchor rode and anchor. It is easy to get hurt when there is a lot of mud on the fluke of the anchor.</p>

<p>We can only heave up a short length of chain at a time. When the chain hook is near the block amidships, we engage the chain stopper, loosen the line at the winch, then move the hook forward, then pull some more, and repeat.</p>

<p>If we have a lot of rope rode out in the water, we use a rope loop(made using a double fisherman's knot, see above) and tie it to the 3-strand nylon rode using a prusik knot.</p>

<p>Like with the chain hauling method, our hauling line attaches to the rope loop forward of the boat, and is led back to a cockpit winch. In the drawing below, we use a bowline to tie the hauling line to the rope loop, but we now have the chain hook secured to the end of the hauling line and put the chain hook through the loop instead, this way we don't have to install the chain hook back onto the line when we arrive at the chain.</p>

<p>When the chain hook arrives amidship at the block, we tie another rope loop using a prusik knot again, we tie it forward on the line to release pressure(this is like engaging the chain stopper). We secure the rope loop on a cleat, then the prusik knot on the hauling line is now relieved of tension and it is possible to slide it back on the line to the front of the boat. When the hauling line is back under tension, we release the second prusik knot, remove it from around the cleat, and remove the loop from the rope rode.</p>

<p>Hauling an anchor this way is not a very fast process, but it works. We tested this method in difficult conditions when we needed to leave {Ratz Harbor} quickly on June 8th 2024, after the weather had turned sour. Note that it is very challenging to do in big weather, everything is under a lot of pressure so you must be careful. It is ok to do under normal conditions, again, it just takes time.</p>

<p><b>Self-tailing winch</b>. We don't have self-tailing winches in the cockpit, having one would make it easier to haul up the anchor. Devine is at the winch and can't hold the line effectively while winching, especially if there is a lot of rope rode out, so the second person goes to the cockpit to hold the bitter end, applying pressure to keep the line tight around the winch drum. Once the chain hook reaches the block admidship, Rek goes to the bow to engage the chain stopper(if hauling chain) or to tie a prusik knot to the rope rode and securing the line to a cleat.</p>

<p>Even if you have an electric or manual windlass aboard, consider carrying extra blocks, a chain hook and rope loops as a safety backup. Your cockpit winches are very powerful, you can haul an anchor with one no problem. Motor boats ought to consider installing a winch somewhere aboard in case of windlass failure, a winch is also useful to pull in a line when stern-tying. Learn how to do a prusik too, practice and master it before you need to do it under pressure.</p>

<p>One major downside of hauling the anchor up this way is that it makes a mess on deck, as we drag a muddy chain over it. If the chain has some rust on it, this too will leave a mark. We have a long streak from bow to amidship that does not wash away easily, it is likely that with some more abrasive products that the stain would go away(we have not tried yet).</p>
