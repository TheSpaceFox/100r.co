<p>We haul the anchor up by hand most times, but when anchored in thick mud or deeper waters we like to lead a line back to the cockpit and to use the above method to haul up the anchor rode and anchor. It is easy to get hurt when there is a lot of mud on the fluke of the anchor.</p>

<p>We can only heave up a short length of chain at a time. When the chain hook is near the block amidships, we engage the chain stopper, loosen the line at the winch, then move the hook forward, then pull some more, and repeat.</p>
