<h2><a id='launching'>Launching Nasu</a></h2>

<p>Nasu is distributed as a rom for the {Uxn} system. To launch it, navigate to the folder in which you want your project files to be saved using the terminal, then enter the following to launch the Nasu rom:</p>

<code>~/roms/nasu.rom</code>

<h2><a id='renaming'>Re-naming a file</a></h2>

<p>The default filename reads <b>untitled.chr</b>. To change it, click on the text. The text field will flash white, click on it and erase the existing filename. Enter the new filename with the .chr extension. Always include the extension when re-naming a file.</p>

<p>Read more about the <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/chr_format.html' target='_blank'>chr file format</a>.</p>

<h2><a id='saving'>Saving a file</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/save.png' class='detail' />

<p>To save a file, click on the white star located on the bottom right of the window.</p>

<p>The star has two states: Grey means the file was saved. White means that the file was changed, and that the change has not yet been saved</li> 

<hr />

<h2><a id='import'>Importing a file</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/load.png' class='detail' />

<p>To import an file, erase the current filename and write the name of the .chr file you wish to import, and click enter. To import the file click on the checkered square on the bottom right of the window.</p>

<p>If switching between projects, close Nasu and navigate to the correct project folder in the terminal prior to launching it again.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='new'>New file</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/blank.png' class='detail' />

<p>To load a blank file, click on the empty square icon on the bottom right of the window.</p>

<p>Make sure to re-name your file.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='blendview'>Blend view</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/blendview.png' class='detail' />

<p>In the blend view there are 4 rows and 4 columns, which display all of the possible color permutations in a project, and allows you to switch through them with ease.</p>

<p>If you have a tile with pixel information selected, the blend view will display that title in different colors. Clicking on one will alter all the tiles on your canvas.</p>

<p>Blend view is useful when you need a tile to display in more than one color in a single project. Note the number under the 4 rows once you've found a suitable blending mode.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='preview'>Pre-view</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/preview.png' class='detail' />

<p>Pre-view is useful when creating spritesheets.</p>

<p>On a spitesheet all tiles that make up a sprite will need to be lined up from left to right. For someone assembling a character that spans multiple titles, it is easier to locate the position of each piece if they follow each other. The issue with having many tiles lined that way, is that if they form a sprite that spans many tiles, it is difficult to make sense of it. By selecting the number of tiles it is meant to fill the pre-view will combine tiles to make a sprite.</p>

<p>Say your sprite is 16x16(or 2x2 tiles). On the canvas the 4 tiles follow each other horizontally. To visualize them as a full sprite, select the starting tile for that sprite (upper left) with the select tool. Tiles will appear in the pre-view. Navigate to the pre-view menu and select 2x2 tiles. The number below indicates the tile size, 2x2 or 22 for our example.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='colorview'>Color view</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/colorview.png' class='detail' />

<p>Color view is located on the top. This view permits you to change colors. There are 3 opaque sliders on a checkered background, moving the sliders will change the colors in Nasu.</p>

<p>The number underneath the sliders is the color code for the project. When making a game, write down this number so you can replicate the color palette of the project.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='zoomview'>Zoom view</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/zoomview.png' class='detail' />

<p>When selecting a tile with pixel information it, an enlargened version of it appears in the zoom view. This is an isolated view of your tile that you can use to make quick changes. It is possible to draw it in directly, and it will alter the version on the canvas.</p>

<p>The up and down arrows will offset the tile to preview an asset that needs to tile perfectly with itself. It's also useful to move a shape up and down by a few pixels without having to re-draw it.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='dataview'>Data view</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/dataview.png' class='detail' />

<p>The data view menu is located on the top right corner of the window, if your canvas is empty it will read 4 rows of 8 zeros with a row of 4 zeros underneath. Data view, as its name suggests, is a way to rapidly preview the code for each tile.</p>

<p>The numbers in the row of 4 numbers changes when clicking in the empty canvas, marking the position of the cursor. This is useful to see where sprites start and end in a .chr file.</p>

<p>If you click on the first upper right tile, the number will read <b>oooo</b>. Moving from left to right, this number will increase until it starts to use letters. This is because {Uxn} uses base-16, a way to identify byte values without having to look at 1's and 0's. It's similar to the number system we use everyday to count with (decimal), in the way that it combines a set of digits to create large numbers (1 paired with a 0 is 10). Like hexadecimal, the language in Uxn uses a set of 16 unique digits. Base-16 uses the standard 0-9 numbers, like the decimal system, but it also incorporates letters: A, B, C, D, E, and F.</p>

<p>The table below shows the letters and numbers used in base-16, and their corresponding collection of 1's and 0's in binary:</p>

<table border='1'>
  <tr><td>0</td><td>0000</td><td>4</td><td>0100</td><td>8</td><td>1000</td><td>C</td><td>1100</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td><td>0001</td><td>5</td><td>0101</td><td>9</td><td>1001</td><td>D</td><td>1101</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2</td><td>0010</td><td>6</td><td>0110</td><td>A</td><td>1010</td><td>E</td><td>1110</td></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td><td>0011</td><td>7</td><td>0111</td><td>B</td><td>1011</td><td>F</td><td>1111</td></tr>
</table>

<p>It isn't crucial to understand the innerworkings of the data view to use Nasu, it is written here in the interest of sharing how things work and what every number or letter represents.</p>

<p>Opening a .chr file with pixel information in a text editor will reveal that the numbers and letters match the ones in your data view. Making sense of a .chr document is tricky, but the data view can help locate and organize specific tiles.</p>

<p>If you fill the canvas with a drawing, the information in the data view will change with letters and numbers. This is your drawing in numbers and letters. Copying this sequence of numbers and letters in a new .chr file would result in the same pixel arrangement.</p>

<h2><a id='colortool'>Color tool</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/colortool.png' class='detail' />

<p>At the bottom left, there are 3 colored circles. You can only ever use 4 colors(including background) in a project. Select a circle to change color. Unselecting all circles will pick black, which by default is the background color. Black assigned as a background color doubles as an eraser. Right-click on a pixel in your canvas to 'erase' it, or to blend it with the background color of your project.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='penciltool'>Pencil tool</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/penciltool.png' class='detail' />

<p>The pencil tool is next to the select tool, used to draw pixels on the canvas.</p>

<p>No further explanation is needed, we think :).</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='selecttool'>Select tool</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/selecttool.png' class='detail' />

<p>The 'select' tool is the arrow, located next to the color tool.</p>

<p>The select tool is used to move between tiles, it's also useful to copy tiles from one place on the canvas to another. To do this, select the tile you wish to duplicate, move elsewhere on the canvas and right-click. The tile will appear on the new spot as a duplicate. This is a useful tool when building spritesheets, or to re-use part of a sprite to draw another pose.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='zoomtool'>Zoom tool</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/zoomtool.png' class='detail' />

<p>For a more detailed view of a drawing, select the zoom tool (magnifying glass).</p>

<p>This view shows outlines of each 8x8 tile, with each drawn pixel appearing as a dot. This tool is useful to make detailed corrrections to a tile. Click on the magnifying glass again to return to the normal view.</p>
