<h2><a id='launching'>Launching Nasu</a></h2>

<p>Nasu is distributed as a rom for the {Uxn} system. In the terminal navigate to the folder in which you want your project files to be saved, then enter the following to launch Nasu rom:</p>

<code>~/roms/nasu.rom</code>

<h2><a id='renaming'>Re-naming a file</a></h2>

<p>The default filename reads <b>untitled.chr</b>. To change it, click on the text. It will flash white, click on the text field and erase the existing filename. Enter the new filename with the .chr extension. Always include the extension when re-naming a file.</p>

<p>Read more about the <a href='https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/chr_format.html' target='_blank'>chr file format</a>.</p>

<h2><a id='saving'>Saving a file</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/save.png' class='detail' />

<p>Click on the white star located on the lower right of the canvas.</p>

<p>The star has two states: Grey means the file was saved. White means that the file was changed and that the change has not yet saved</li> 

<p>The state change makes it easy to know if you still have unsaved changes.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='import'>Importing a file</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/load.png' class='detail' />

<p>To import an file, erase the current filename and write the name of the .chr file you wish to import, and click enter. To import the file click on the checkered square next to the star (save) icon. The checkered square will import your file.</p>

<p>If switching between projects, close Nasu and navigate to the correct project folder in the terminal prior to launching it again.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='new'>New file</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/blank.png' class='detail' />

<p>To load a blank file, click on the empty square next to the checkered square icon.</p>

<p>Be sure to re-name your file.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='blendview'>Blend view</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/blendview.png' class='detail' />

<p>In the Blend View there are 4 rows, and 4 columns, which correspond to all of the color possibilities in a project.</p>

<p>If you have a tile with pixel information selected, the blend view will display all the color possibilities. Clicking on one will alter the tiles on your canvas. Each row has 4 options for colors that you can choose from. Selecting the space on the first column of the first row will change your tile to tone on tone, if you select the second space on that row it changes the color arrangement.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='preview'>Pre-view</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/preview.png' class='detail' />

<p>The second top menu may appear cryptic, and will only be useful when creating spritesheets.</p>

<p>Typically, when preparing files for a project all of the tiles for a given sprite will need to be lined up from left to right. For someone assembling a character than spans multiple titles for a game, it is easier to locate the position of each piece if they follow each other. The issue with having many tiles lined that way, is that if they form a sprite that spans many tiles, it is difficult to make sense of it. The pre-view permits you to view the whole sprite by selecting the number of tiles it is meant to fill.</p>

<p>Say your sprite is 16x16 pixels, or 2x2 tiles, on the canvas the 4 tiles will follow each other horizontally. To visualize them as a full sprite, select the starting tile for that sprite with the select(arrow) tool. Pieces appear in the pre-view, if you navigate to that window and select 2x2 tiles, the asset will appear as it ought to look when assembled. The number below indicates the tile size, 2x2 or 22 for our example project</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='colorview'>Color view</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/colorview.png' class='detail' />

<p>Color view is located on the top bar, third menu. This view permits you to change colors. There are 3 opaque sliders on a checkered background, moving the sliders will change the colors in Nasu.</p>

<p>The number underneath the sliders is the color code for the project. When making a game, write down this number so you can replicate the color scheme of the project.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='zoomview'>Zoom view</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/zoomview.png' class='detail' />

<p>When selecting a tile with pixel information it, you'll notice that an enlargened version of it appears on the fourth menu on the top bar. This is an isolated view of your tile that you can use to make quick changes (you can draw it in, and it will change the version on the canvas).</p>

<p>The up and down arrows permit you to offset the tile, say if you need to preview an asset that needs to tile perfectly with another. It's also useful if you want to move a shape up and down by a few pixels without having to re-draw it.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='dataview'>Data view</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/dataview.png' class='detail' />

<p>The data view menu is located on the upper right corner of the window, if your canvas is empty it will read 4 rows of 8 zeros, with a row of 4 zeros underneath. Data view, as its name suggests, is a way to rapidly view the code for each asset.</p>

<p>The numbers in row of 4 numbers change as you click around in the empty canvas, marking the position of your cursor. This is useful to identify and locate where sprites start and end in a .chr file. If you click on the first upper right tile, the number will read oooo. Moving from left to right this number will increase until it starts to use letters. This is because {Uxn} uses base-16, a way to identify byte(8 bits form one byte) values without having to look at 1's and 0's. It's similar to the number system we use everyday to count with (decimal), in the way that it combines a set of digits to create large numbers (1 paired with a 0 is 10). Like hexadecimal (colors), the language in Uxn uses a set of 16 unique digits. Base-16 uses the standard 0-9 numbers, like the decimal system, but it also incorporates letters: A, B, C, D, E, and F.</p>

<p>The table below shows the letters and numbers used in base-16, and their corresponding collection of 1's and 0's in binary:</p>

<table border='1'>
  <tr><td>0</td><td>0000</td><td>4</td><td>0100</td><td>8</td><td>1000</td><td>C</td><td>1100</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td><td>0001</td><td>5</td><td>0101</td><td>9</td><td>1001</td><td>D</td><td>1101</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2</td><td>0010</td><td>6</td><td>0110</td><td>A</td><td>1010</td><td>E</td><td>1110</td></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td><td>0011</td><td>7</td><td>0111</td><td>B</td><td>1011</td><td>F</td><td>1111</td></tr>
</table>

<p>It isn't crucial to understand this to use Nasu, it is written here in the interest of sharing what things work and what every number or letter represents.</p>

<p>When drawing pixels in the canvas, numbers and letters will appear in the upper 4 rows of 0's. If you save your file, and open the .chr file in a text editor, the numbers and letters will match the ones in your data view. Making sense of a .chr document is tricky, but the data view can help locate specific tiles.</p>

<p>If you fill the canvas with a drawing, the information in the data view will change with letters and numbers. This is your drawing in numbers and letters. Copying this sequence of numbers and letters in a new .chr file would result in the same pixel arrangement.</p>

<h2><a id='colortool'>Color tool</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/colortool.png' class='detail' />

<p>At the bottom left, there are 3 colored circles. You can only ever use 4 colors(including background) in a project. Change color by selecting a circle. Unselecting all circles will default to black, which by default is the background color. Black assigned as background color doubles as an eraser. Right-click on a pixel in your canvas to 'erase' it.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='penciltool'>Pencil tool</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/penciltool.png' class='detail' />

<p>The pencil tool is next to the select tool, used to draw pixels on the canvas.</p>

<p>No further explanation is needed, we think :).</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='selecttool'>Select tool</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/selecttool.png' class='detail' />

<p>The 'select' tool is the arrow, located next to the color tool.</p>

<p>The select tool is used to move between tiles, it's also useful to copy tiles from one place on the canvas to another. To do this, select the tile you wish to duplicate, move elsewhere and right-click. The tile will appear on the new spot as a duplicate. This is a useful tool when building spritesheets.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a id='zoomtool'>Zoom tool</a></h2>

<img src='../media/content/tools/nasu/zoomtool.png' class='detail' />

<p>For a more detailed view of your drawing, select the 'magnifying glass' tool located on the right of the select tool.</p>

<p>This view shows outlines of each 8x8 tile, with each pixel appearing as a dot. This tool is useful to make detailed corrrections to a tile. Click on the magnifying glass again to return to the normal view.</p>
