<p><b>Note</b>. Land adknowledgements to come, when we have more bandwith to properly research what nations/bands are on this land.</p>

<p>At 5h30 in the morning, while in bed, we overheard the captain of our dock neighbor hailing the Winchelsea navy tracking station to ask if Whiskey Golf was active, and to our delight, we heard that no, it wasn't. Perfect. Our plan was to leave at 6h30, and to listen to the radio to find out (weather station WX announces it).<br>When leaving from Silva Bay, having to take a detour around the active area is not the end of the world because it doesn't extend too far that way, it is more restrictive if leaving from Nanaimo. Either way, it meant that we could point directly to our destination.</p>

<p>We pushed off, motored out of Silva Bay, raised the sails and took off. A bald eagle watched us as we left, perched on a rock on Rowboat Pt, NW of Gaviola Island. As soon as we cleared all of the small islands around Gabriola, the waves and wind started to build out of the SE, and Pino began to move at a rapid 7-8 knots. The wind was forecast to be 20 kts, and this wind stayed with us for the duration of our 25nm long crossing.</p>

<p>The sky was grey, and we got some rain(only a little). We thought it nice to have a break from the sun.</p>

<p>The waves can get quite big in this Strait, especially with a good SE wind blowing. The water is open all the way down to Bellingham WA, it has a long time to travel, and to build into something fearsome. The waves are big with not much time between swells, unlike ocean waves, which makes for a choppy, bumpy ride. Pino had a full main and jib, and was overall well-balanced, and still, the boat rolled with every wave. We had the wind on the starboard quarter. Our boat handles this well enough, but it makes doing anything inside a bit difficult. We managed to cook some oatmeal for breakfast, but decided to only have coffee at our destination.</p>

<p>We crossed paths with a humpback whale, it surfaced right near us, and we made a quick 90-degree turn to get out of its way. We saw another far away, its spray rising from the water. "A lot of whale traffic this morning," we thought.</p>

<p>We arrived at the mouth to Smuggler Cove fast, 3 1/2 hours later. We passed through Welcome Passage, avoiding having to go round the west side of Thormanby. The waves died down at the south end, and we had a nice quiet sail, breaking our habit of having anywhere new in boisterous conditions.</p>

<p>The entrance to Smuggler Cove is a bit tricky, it is narrow, and winding. It is a good idea to keep close to Capri Island to avoid some shoals. We arrived at low tide, to find the anchorage to be rather tight. All of that exposed land made the place feel restricted, and unfriendly. The tides are bigger than in the Gulf Islands here, with a 16 feet difference. At low tide, a lot of land becomes exposed. We saw 4 boats anchored and stern-tied in the outer bay, and only one in the second bay. We decided to drop anchor in the second bay, avoiding the third entirely because of its depth.</p>

<p>We found a spot that permitted us to anchor with the bow in the SE, with the wind that day. Some boats sometimes don't get to pick where they want to go because the anchorage is full, and they get the wind beam on... making stern-tying a very difficult affair, especially if there are other boats around to avoid. No one likes playing bumper boats.</p>

<p>We put the dinghy in the water quickly, dropped the anchor in 5 ft of water in mud (yes, <i>very</i> shallow at low tide), and backed towards the shore, letting out enough rode (49°30.851N, 123°57.881W). Then, Rek leapt into the dinghy, grabbed the end of the floating line and rowed to shore. The anchorage provides stern-tie rings, long lengths of chain bolted into rock, to spare the trees. Thankfully, in this area, it is easy to get to the rings, even at low tide, and even if it requires climbing over barnacle and slippery algae-covered rocks.</p>

<p>High tide was at 19h00 that day, when the water is high the bay takes on a welcoming appearance. Passes between land get covered with water, and the land gets divided into many smaller islands. At high tide, if we look past our stern, we see Texada Island.</p>

<p>A regatta of geese came by to see us, to see if we had set our anchor right. They didn't look impressed.</p>

<p>Being stern-tied makes {solar cooking} a bit easier, we don't need to adjust the solar cooker as often. On our first day here, we solar cooked some seitan.</p>

<p>The anchorage is surrounded by walking trails. We took a short walk on the first day, but plan to take many more!</p>
