<h1>engine rebuild</h1><p><b>21.08.04<br>Sidney BC, Canada</b></p>

<p>In the winter of 2021, we started to have engine issues with Calcifer, our Yanmar 2GM raw water cooled diesel engine.</p>

<p>The problems began while doing regular maintenance. We inspected the exhaust elbow. The elbow was held onto the engine head with 3 bolts, we found that two out of the 3 were rusted in place. What to do, what to do! In the end, we had to drill them out. Drilling into stainless steel is a tedious, backbreaking affair.</p>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/engine4.jpg' title='many weeks in the engine room' loading='lazy'>

<p>We successfully drilled out the first, after many days and many cobalt drill bits. The second hole started well, but then we had the brilliant idea to use a screw extractor. Predictably, the tip broke inside of the hole. We could not pry it out. The only thing to do then was to drill through it. Cobalt bits don't work for this, so we used some grinding stones and a dremel. Again, after many days and hours, the extractor fell to pieces. The problem now was that we had damaged the sides of the hole in the processâ€”great.</p>

<p>The problems didn't end there, by then the hole wasn't deep enough so we continued sacrificing drill bits. But then, one of them snapped in two in the hole, with the end again, stuck in there.</p>

<p>We wanted to scream.</p>

<p>What can you use to drill out cobalt? Is there anything that can go through that? By then it felt like we'd been living in the engine room. We were both tired, and afraid to break something else in that space. But finally, we were able to get most of the damn bit out.</p>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/engine5.jpg' title='broken bits and extractor' loading='lazy'>

<p>We were able to tap and thread the first hole correctly, but not the second. For the second, we had to drill a bigger hole and to use some SS thread repair inserts (by OEMTOOLS). The entire ordeal was a pain, especially because the larger bolt hole also meant we had to enlargen the hole in the elbow plate too. We also had to find a bigger bolt. Then of course, we had alignment issues, but eventually, we inserted a new gasket and placed the elbow back on. Success.</p>

<p>We fired the engine and all seemed fine, but... BUT, we saw oil in the exhaust water. "What NOW?!" we said, distraught and near-defeated. Our boat was leaving a nasty sheen behind. We assumed that this was left-over loose carbon from the elbow, since we had messed around in there. People told us to run the engine long, and hard. They said to go around the bay for an hour to test it. We did this, but found that this did not help.</p>

<p>We checked the dipstick for water in the oil. We didn't find water... but noticed that the oil level was down. We were now certain that the sheen in the water was from oil. Somehow, the oil in the engine was breaking past its seal and mixing with sea water. Now, we knew better than to try and run Calcifer. We didn't want to disperse any more engine oil in the water.</p>

<p>By then it was June, and we had to leave the Victoria Harbor for a haul-out in North Saanich. We made it all the way there by sail and by using our new-to-us <a href='oars.html' class='local'>oars</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking to Ben Gartside, a well-known local diesel mechanic, we were told that the best thing to do was to check the head for pin holes. On raw water cooled engines pin holes often form in the head. We removed the it and we found the culprit, a pinhole at the point where the elbow meets the head. The good news was that we had found the problem, but the bad news was that all the work we had done prior to that point was for NOTHING because we wouldn't be able to keep the head. Fantastic. Had we had more experience with engines, we would have taken the head off first to look for issues, but it took us a long while to gather the courage to do it. In hindsight, it is an easy thing to do, we had no reason to be afraid.</p>

<p>Although, removing the head for nothing is not ideal, because it means you have to replace the gasket. Having an extra on hand is important.</p>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/engine3.jpg' title='dreaded pin hole' loading='lazy'>

<p>It was likely that the pin hole was there a while, but that the built-up carbon was blocking the passage. When doing maintenance on the elbow we had cleaned the area, and in the process we had dislodged the carbon. After that the oil could pass freely, unhindered. It was a problem waiting to surface, if not now, then later. I am glad we found it earlier.</p>

<p>Now we knew the source of our engine issues, but weren't sure what to do next. We knew there were ways to repair the pinhole, such as 'pinning', but we didn't trust that as a long-term, dependable solution. In a bind pinning is a useful technique.</p>

<p>Ben told us that he had a spare Yanmar engine head he could sell us. He also mentioned having a Yanmar 2GM20F engine. Ben was re-building it, but it was missing some parts.</p>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/engine.jpg' title='half of calcifer remains' loading='lazy'>

<p>Our engine wasn't doing too bad, but it was due for a re-build. We wondered if getting a freshwater cooled engine instead would be better. Ben told us that the 2GM and 2GM20F were very similar, so we agreed to use parts of our 2GM to fix it up. Combining the two engines was a sort of rebuild. As freshwater cooling was better ideal overall while in salt water. Because the engine wasn't new, we'd get it at a good price.</p>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/engine2.jpg' title='the two calcifer engines together' loading='lazy'>

<p>On August 3rd, our boat was towed to the Gartside dock, and we hauled Calcifer out with the help of a crane. By then, it was lighter because it was missing many parts which had been appended to Calcifer II.</p>

<img src='../media/content/knowledge/engine6.jpg' title='goodbye calcifer' loading='lazy'>

<p>Then, Calcifer II moved in. Re-aligning the engine was tricky, the engines were similarly-sized, but we had to re-drill holes for the engine mounts.</p>

<p>Soon.</p>
