<h1>offshore</h1><p>If you want to go offshore, there is a long list of safety items, tools and spares that you need to have.</p>

<p>Consult a <a href='https://www.vicmaui.org/official-notice-board' target='_blank' class='external'>vessel and equipment checks list</a> (Safety Consultation Checklist). Another helpful reference document for gearing up for offshore travel, is the <a href='https://astrolabesailing.com/2014/03/24/yachting-nz-cat-1/' target='_blank' class='external'>New Zealand Cat 1 requirements list</a>. New Zealand registered yachts can't go offshore without passing a Cat 1 survey, if they don't pass, they can't leave.</p>

<p>Before every long passage, we do a thorough check of all equipment on board, this means looking at the stitching on the sails, testing the electronics, checking the running and standing rigging etc. For the first time, have someone with you to help, you can also hire professionals to inspect your boat. For example, we hired a rigger to inspect Pino's standing rigging when we were planning to go offshore for the first time. We asked him a lot of questions, watched how he did things etc.</p>
<p>In short, here's what you ought to do, or ought to have to sail offshore:</p>

<p><b>Med-kit</b>. The contents and storage of the First Aid Kit shall reflect the likely conditions and duration of the passage, and the number of crew.</p>

<p><b>Cockpit knife</b>. A strong, sharp knife, sheathed and securely restrained shall be provided readily accessible from the deck or a cockpit.</p>

<p><b>Radar reflector</b>. Be seen by larger ships, get one. Even better, is an AIS transponder, but not essential.</p>

<p><b>lifejackets</b>. Make sure it comes with a sailing harness, and ideally crotch strap. Carry extra refills if auto-inflating, as it isn't standardized (can't get specific models shipped by air, so carry enough).</p>

<p><b>Bolt/tie everything down</b>. Modern boats don't always have bolted floors, or latches. If note, add some. Add a strap to tie down your engine, in case it comes loose so it doesn't come crashing through the cabin.</p>

<p><b>Tethers</b>. So you can tether yourself when outside in the cockpit, or if doing work on deck. Get short tethers, rather than long ones. Also, if you can, get a tether with 3 clips, so if you unclip to clip elsewhere, you're always tied to one spot.</p>

<p><b>Jacklines</b>. Set up jacklines that run along the deck, that you can clip your tether onto to do work on deck. Make sure jacklines are tight.</p>

<p><b>Storm sail</b>. Get a trysail, and/or storm jib. Or add a third reef to your main. A storm jib is useful even if you don't encounter storm conditions, as it's possible to use to self-steer using the poled-out storm jib method. If your windvane, or autopilot fails, this is a great, tested technique to self-steer a boat in any condition.</p>

<p><b>Bungees, surgical tube or bike tube</b>. Good for self-steering, again, in case your windpilot fails.</p>

<p><b>Flashlights</b>. Plenty of waterproof flashlights, distribute them around the cabin. Get a light that is rechargable by hand, for emergencies.</p>

<p><b>Bolt cutters</b>. The largest pair you can carry.</p>

<p><b>Handheld VHF</b>. Useful as backup should your main radio fail, also useful to throw in a ditch bag, or to find out your position if having chart plotter issues.</p>

<p><b>Sextant</b>. Electronics are prone to failure, and knowing where you are in the world is important. A sextant can save your life.</p>

<p><b>Emergency manual pump</b>. Or another manual bilge pump, workable from inside the cabin.</p>

<p>Traveling offshore costs more because the boat is under more stress. Repair and maintenance can cost between 500-800$ per year for a 10 m yacht like ours. This price goes up and down depending on where we go, and what has to be replaced that year. In 2018 while in New Zealand, we spent around <a href='projects_and_pain.html'>10,000$ on Pino</a> to get it ready for Japan and the subsequent trip to Canada. This was the most we'd spent in a year, and was due to the purchase of a new AIS system, mainsail, throttle cables, replacement windows, top hatch, galley plumbing, replacement batteries and solar panels.</p>
