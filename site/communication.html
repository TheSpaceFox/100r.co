<h1>communication</h1><p>As a sailor, you <b>must offer help</b> to a boat in trouble. <a href='radio.html'>radio</a> communication is key, specific channels are used in every country for emergencies or information exchange. Every morning, sailors will tune in to a specific channel and listen to a <b>morning net</b>, a public radio exchange in which the weather and local events are announced, as well as boats seeking crew, or items that need to be sold or found. When the weather is foul, the local channels are very busy.</p>

<p>There is an unspoken understanding between long-distance sailors, an exchange of looks when foul weather is amidst. Every member of the sailing community knows the difficulties of life at sea, and is ready to lend a hand. We refer to each other by boat name, and like bird-watchers, we can identify rare breeds by sight. When transiting through world routes, we meet the same boats often, thus strenghtening the connection. Talking to other sailors, and exchanging information is extremely valuable. You will make friendships for life.</p>

<p>On our 5-year cruise around the Pacific Ocean, we used an Iridium GO SAT phone to relay our position to our land crew (Devine's dad), and to communicate with our friends and family. Is it an expensive option, and should you choose this route we recommend getting an unlimited plan because data minutes run out quickly. The Iridium connects to overhead satellites and demands a stable connection to download weather data, like <a href='grib_files.html'>grib files</a>.
