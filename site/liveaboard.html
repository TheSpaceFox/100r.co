<p>When living on the water, your home is always in motion, swaying with the currents and winds. Knowing that your vessel is not permanently tethered to the earth is a good feeling, it means you can go anywhere.</p>

<p>Our primary mode of transport has always been a bicycle, it's quiet, and we're free to move myself around wherever, and whenever we want. Traveling by sailboat, is taking this a step further, you can move yourself over from one continent to the other.</p>

<p>If you want to live in a sailboat, you don't have to sail offshore. There is much to be experienced and seen while staying in one country, but if you have the itch to leave, you can do it. There are many other benefits to having a floating home.</p>

<h2 id='galley tools'><a href='galley tools.html'>galley tools</a></h2><p>As with most things in life, 20% of anything does 80% of the work. When moving into a smaller space, it is important to find that 20% and surround yourself with things purposefully. Single-serving tools and kitchenware will not do.</p>
<p>We choose durable(stainless steel, quality wood), multi-functional and simple (unibody, non-electric) <a href='https://grimgrains.com/#tools' target='_blank' class='external'>tools</a>.</p>

<p>We do enjoy having some fizzy water now and again, but hate to have to purchase bottles for it. We decided against getting a soda stream given the fact that its bottles are proprietary and cannot be filled by anyone other than them. Making your own system is way better, and if you've got a big tank it'll last for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Here's what you'll need to get, this is also the order in which you need to connect them together:</p>
<ul>
    <li>5KG CO2 tank</li>
    <li>A regulator</li>
    <li>1m of of vinyl tubing</li>
    <li>A ball-lock keg coupler</li>
    <li>A carbonator bottle cap</li>
    <li>A soda bottle (for carbonation with a reinforced bottom).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='water'><a href='water.html'>water</a></h2><p>It's easy to forget that water is not inexhaustible when it flows so readily by the turn of the tap. Living on a boat certainly helps to develop a deeper connection to this precious resource. Depending on where you are, you'll have to treat it, catch it, carry it or pay for it.</p>
<p>Basic needs are covered with a mere 10 liters of water a day per person. A person needs between 2.7 and 3.7 liters of drinking water each day. When anchored near a port, once a week, we would ferry four bins of 10 liters from shore to the boat. To conserve water, our sink faucet is operated with a foot pump, where each push draws out 60 ml of water, allowing us to measure our usage.</p>
<p>On passages, we carry extra Jerrycans of water, enough to sustain two people for a few more weeks than the length of our trip. Having separate bins makes for a more resilient system, if salt gets into one tank, it won't corrupt the entirety of your supplies. A sure way of preventing contamination, is to check all o-rings and tanks for leaks before leaving. We chose not to have a desalinator aboard Pino, and have managed well without it. It's a device that is expensive, high maintenance and power-hungry.</p>
<p>When at anchor, catching <a href='rain.html' class='local'>rain</a> is a good way to replenish a water tank.</p>

<h2 id='power'><a href='power.html'>power</a></h2><img src='../media/content/knowledge/power.jpg' />
<p class='quote'>Halving requirements is the same as doubling capacity.<br>- Nigel Calder</p>

<p>There are working alternatives to most powered devices on a boat. Keeping consumptions low reduces the need for extra solar, keeping costs down and reducing the amount of things that can break, or fail.</p>

<p>To measure current power usage, make a list of indispensable electric systems and their energy requirements, including lighting, appliances, laptops etc. Look up their power usage in watts, for example, a Macbook Pro draws 30 W when in use. If in use for 6 consecutive hours, it would draw roughly 160W per day. Wattage varies depending on the task performed on the computer, for instance video editing is more resource intensive than writing. Adding up the wattage will give a rough estimate of daily use.</p>

<p>The energy coming from solar panels fluctuates based on the angle of the sun, cloud coverage and other obstructions. Power usage aboard varies a lot from day to day, depending on what task is done that day. While on passage, our own capability to capture sunlight is reduced to keep our windage low, but our energy consumption is equally reduced for not much else is drawing power than our navigation electronics like the AIS, the wind meter, and at night, the lights.</p>

<p>An anchored board will orbit its anchor according to the wind, and rarely stays in the same spot and so it is difficult to position panels to guarantee an optimal draw. On cloudless days the mast may cast a shadow covering a large part of the panels. On moments such as this, or cloudy days, it is best to adapt by using appliances less, and to learn to live according to the <a href='weather.html' class='local'>weather</a>.</p>

<p>For each 100 people telling us to "just install more solar panels", only 1 person will consider ways to reduce power usage. Instead of scaling our battery banks to our needs, we chose to adapt our needs to the available space for batteries and surface for panels. It's also important to consider that more solar panels often mean more windage. Having a complex system exposed to a harsh environment like the sea, creates opportunities for things to break. Saltwater corrosion is a very real threat. Nowadays, many electronics, or 'smart' systems, use proprietary parts, making them difficult to repair. We've encountered many boats, stuck in port for weeks and weeks, waiting for parts to arrive. An over-reliance on convenience products may bind you to services on land, in a way that you may not want.</p>


<h2 id='privacy'><a href='privacy.html'>privacy</a></h2><p>There is no privacy on a small boat. It's something you must prepare for. If you have plans to travel for extended periods of time with another person, you must be compatible, you must discuss problems when they arise and express concerns right away.</p>
<p>The combined space, below and atop deck, is bigger than it seems. If you are near land, there is always the option of going for a walk.</p>
<h2 id='laundry'><a href='laundry.html'>laundry</a></h2><p>In populated cities, we carry dirty clothes ashore to a laundromat. If there aren't any, we do our own washing. We wash them by hand with <a href='rain.html' class='local'>rain</a> water, a set of buckets and a brush. The clothes are brushed and washed in soapy water once, then rinsed in fresh water.</p>
<p>For white clothes, or stained garments, we like to soak them in a bucket with some <a href='https://www.chemistrystore.com/sodium_percarbonate2.pdf' target='_blank'>sodium percarbonate</a>. It destains, deodorizes, whitens and is non-toxic to marine life. It breaks down to oxygen, water and sodium carbonate (soda ash) in your wash water.</p>
<p>When underway during long passages, we tend to wear the same clothes for a long, long time. If ever we do need to wash clothes, we'll do a quick salt water wash to save water, and rinse with fresh water. The clothes are hung out to dry on the lifelines, or on a separate line that we set up. Leaving dark clothes out to dry in the sun will cause it to discolour faster - such is the cost of sailing in warm places.</p>
<h2 id='moorage'><a href='moorage.html'>moorage</a></h2><p>Living at anchor, that is, in a bay somewhere tethered to the earth with <a href='ground_tackle.html' class='local'>ground tackle</a> is free. Some bays will have moorings installed that you can tie to for a small fee (often around $10-15.). Living at anchor is the cheap way to go, although getting a good anchor and rode is important as it will keep your boat safe.</p>

<p>Some bays will have moorings installed that you can tie to for a small fee (often around 10-15$.)</p>

<p>Marinas often have guest docks with power, WiFi and showers, for a medium-to-high cost ($300-$800.) The longer the boat though, the bigger the cost. Some marinas charge per dock space rather than boat size, beware of these places. Moorage near cities is more expensive, and the price goes up during the high season (summer). Winter moorage is generally much cheaper.</p>

<p>Paying for annual moorage is a good idea, but keeping a boat in a marina means getting liability insurance, which in turn, means you'll need a survey, resulting in a seemingly interminable domino effect which can incur many more costs. Depending on the age of your boat, and when it was last surveyed (if ever), you may need a full condition out-of-water survey. This means paying a marina to lift your boat out, and paying the surveyor. A surveyor will point out mandatory items that need fixing and/or replacing, if these items are not complied with within 60 days the insurance will be void.</p>

<p>Living aboard your boat will cause wear from regular use of the space. If staying at a marina in your home country for long periods, paying for <b>liveaboard fees</b> (up to $150 extra per month) is necessary. If staying in a marina in a foreign country, liveaboard fees are often waived. Some marinas charge for electricity and water, be sure to take that into account, especially if you have plans to winter there and that your heating is electric. In winter, marinas charge less than in the high season. For example, the city docks in Victoria costs us 570$ a month in winter, and summer rates are about $880S.</p>
