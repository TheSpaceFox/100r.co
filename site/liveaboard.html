        <h2 id='diy_carbonation_system'>diy carbonation system</h2>
        <img src='../media/content/knowledge/carbonation.jpg' />
        <p>We do enjoy having some fizzy water now and again, but hate to have to purchase bottles for it. We decided against getting a soda stream given the fact that its bottles are proprietary and cannot be filled by anyone other than them. Making your own system is way better, and if you've got a big tank it'll last for a long, long time.</p>
        <p>Here's what you'll need to get, this is also the order in which you need to connect them together:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>5KG CO2 tank</li>
            <li>A regulator</li>
            <li>1m of of vinyl tubing</li>
            <li>A ball-lock keg coupler</li>
            <li>A carbonator bottle cap</li>
            <li>A soda bottle (for carbonation with a reinforced bottom).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id='habitat'>habitat</h2>
        <p>As with most things in life, 20% of anything does 80% of the work. When moving into a smaller space, it is important to find that 20% and surround yourself with things purposefully. Single-serving tools and kitchenware will not do.</p>
        <p>Investing in good quality <b>army blankets and waterproof sleepingbags</b> will make a world of difference. Non-metallic(bamboo or ceramic) kitchenware is also essential, everything rusts on a boat - even stainless-steel. To keep our clothes dry, we store them in large sealed industrial plastic containers.</p>

        <h2 id='water_storage'>water storage</h2>
        <p>Our main tank carries 170 L, our secondary has 50 L, while an additional 100 L is stored in jerry cans. When it is not possible to dock at a marina, we use smaller(4x10L) jerry cans to ferry water from shore. While it requires more trips, the lighter containers are less prone to breakage.</p>

        <h2 id='electricity'>electricity</h2><img src='../media/content/knowledge/leds.jpg' />
        <p>We have 2 Solar Panels(1 x 100W and 1 X 90W). For additional power, we also carry a Honda EU1000i generator. Our boat has a 75AMP Balmar alternator, but it is only used to charge the batteries on cloudy days. Every single light is LED, cutting down the consumption of power, from lights, by 10 compared to halogens.</p>
        <p>On Pino, we've got a total of 464 Ah. Our flooded-cell battery banks consists of a series configured starter bank (2x6 Volt Cells) and a series-parallel configured house bank (2x6V cells). Both sets are identical, equalling 12 v each. Because they're identical, we often use both as house banks.</p>
        <p>There are working alternatives to most powered devices on a boat. We don't have a windlass, pressure faucet, water heater or a fridge. Because of this, it's easy to keep our power consumption low, reducing our need for extra solar, keeping our costs down and reducing the amount of things that can break, or fail.</p>

        <h2 id='privacy'>privacy</h2>
        <p>There is none. It's something you must prepare for. If you have plans to travel for extended periods of time with another person, you must be compatible, you must discuss problems when they arise and express concerns right away.</p>
        <p>The combined space, below and atop deck, is bigger than it seems. If you are near land, there is always the option of going for a walk.</p>

        <h2 id='laundry'>laundry</h2>
        <p>In populated cities, we carry dirty clothes ashore to a laundromat. If there aren't any, we do our own washing. We wash them by hand with <a href='off_the_grid.html#rain_catchment'>collected rain water</a>, a set of buckets and a brush. The clothes are brushed and washed in soapy water once, then rinsed in fresh water.</p>
        <p>For white clothes, or stained garments, we like to soak them in a bucket with some <a href='https://www.chemistrystore.com/sodium_percarbonate2.pdf' target='_blank'>sodium percarbonate</a>. It destains, deodorizes, whitens and is non-toxic to marine life. It breaks down to oxygen, water and sodium carbonate (soda ash) in your wash water.</p>
        <p>When underway during long passages, we tend to wear the same clothes for a long, long time. If ever we do need to wash clothes, we'll do a quick salt water wash to save water, and rinse with fresh water. The clothes are hung out to dry on the lifelines, or on a separate line that we set up. Leaving dark clothes out to dry in the sun will cause it to discolour faster - such is the cost of sailing in warm places.</p>
        
        <h2 id='costs'>costs</h2>
        <p>Living aboard your boat may incur extra costs, as more is required for comfort, storage etc. Being aboard full-time will wear the boat down in ways different than those caused by racing, as the wear will occur primarily inside the cabin, like the wearing of the varnish/finish on floors and counters, and of the regular use of plumbing in the galley and in the head. This goes on top of regular spendings on maintenance, the cost of which varies depending on the size, material and age of the boat. Maintenance on our boat, traveling offshore, costs us roughly 3000$ per year, this price went up and down depending on what had to be replaced that year. Costs on our boat was higher after purchase as the gear aboard was old (was built in 1982). We spent a lot of money between 2016 and 2020 because we went offshore in difficult waters with our boat. Living aboard in your home country, in inland waters won't cost nearly as much, especially if you anchor out.</p>
        <p>Spending time at anchor is free, but if staying at a marina in your home country for long periods, paying for 'liveaboard fees' (up to 150$ extra per month) is necessary. If staying in a marina in a foreign country, liveaboard fees are waived.</p>

        <h2 id='tools'>Tools for repair</h2>
        <p>Basic tools to make repairs to the varieties parts of your boat.</p>

        <p class='quote'>"Carry only those tools that fit the fasteners that hold the various bits of your boat together and you will have what you need and wonâ€™t be burdened by what you donâ€™t." â€” Don Casey</p>
