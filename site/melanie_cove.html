<p>On June 10 2022, we left <a href='grace_harbour.html' class='local'>grace harbour</a> on a day with 15-25 knots from the southeast in the forecast, only to find the wind on the nose instead of in the back. The mountains and various islands in the area cause the wind to funnel and curl around islands, making it difficult to plan a trip if you don't know the area. The wind was only blowing at 10 knots, but we were able to use it to get past Mink Island. Once past Otter Island, the land seemed to part, revealing tall, beautiful snow-covered mountains in the background.</p>

<p>We made our way into the entrance to Prideaux Haven. The entrance was tricky, with a rock on the starboard side, and a set of shoals just ahead, it is necessary to do a quick turn after the rock to avoid the shoals. Our boat is small, but we found the entrance tight. It is crazy to think that super yachts come and anchor in here in the summer, we had difficulty imagining a large 60-foot boat trying to turn around the rock and then to turn quickly again to miss the next obstacle... but they do it.</p>

<p>We moved past the main anchorage and dropped the hook in Melanie Cove. The bay is overrun by moon jellyfish. There are so many that it looks like it is raining, but it is their tops hitting the surface of the water that is creating ripples.</p>

<p>A shoal lies near shore, and with an ebbing tide the shoal seems to draw a path towards our stern, a sort of land-bridge to Pino... revealing more of itself as the water recedes, but things always look closer than they are from a boat. We were a good distance away. Humans eyes are terrible with distances, finding a good anchoring spot can be difficult because of that, especially when looking from the bow.</p>

<p>There were 4 other boats already in the bay, and we had plenty of room to free-swing.</p>

<p>We had some sun that day, and rowed over to Dakota's boat to soak up some sun on their deck. Their bow is large enough to accommodate 4 chairs. They left for Refuge Cove the next day to try and pick up some fresh produce. They told us that the store there received new shipments on Saturdays, but on their visit there wasn't a crazy variety, it is still too early in the season and they will likely offer more come July. Still, they picked up a small green cabbage and a half red cabbage for us, to add to our dwindling supplies.</p>

<p>Melanie Cove is where Mike Shutter's cabin used to be, the guy that Wylie Blanchett talks about in the book The Curve of Time. It's funny, our good friend Chris gave us this book as a leaving present when we left to circle the Pacific in 2016, we read it while underway but because it is about boating in Desolation and the Broughtons, and that we had not yet been, it was difficult to picture it all. Now, we are re-reading it and the places that she describes are coming to life, like a ghost suddenly gaining flesh. The cabin is no longer there, but it is nice to think about Mike living here, alone, logging entire trees on his own. I also enjoy the idea of Caprice anchored here, with few boats around to bother them.</p>

<p>Because it is early in the season, there aren't too many boats here now, and we are glad of it.</p>
