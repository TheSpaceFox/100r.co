<p>Doing maintenance and repairs yourself will bring the cost down. Offloading work to professionals if you can afford it is fine, but it's good to know how to take care of your boat. You may not always have access to workers if sailing to far-flung islands.</p>

<p>A failure to maintain items regularly will cost more later. We recommend keeping a log of the repairs, part replacements that is done to your boat. Many parts have a limited lifespan, so knowing when they were replaced last will help prevent breakages. If leaving for a big sailing trip with spares, <b>install the spare and keep the other one as the spare</b>. If you do this, you'll learn how to change the part and what tools you need to do the job.</p>

<p>When doing repairs, use quality materials and products, research them thoroughly before a project instead of relying on brand names.</p>

<h2 id='maintenance_checklist'><a href='maintenance_checklist.html'>maintenance checklist</a></h2><p>Short list:</p>

</ul>
<h2 id='effect_of_combining_dissimilar_metals'><a href='effect_of_combining_dissimilar_metals.html'>effect of combining dissimilar metals</a></h2><p>Take care when choosing fasteners for your boat. When dissimilar metals are placed in contact with each other, introducing an electrolyte(like fresh or saltwater) will trigger corrosion.</p>

<p>When water(electrolyte) is introduced onto metals that are very galvanically incompatible(ex: stainless steel and galvanized steel), one metal becomes a negatively-charged cathode, and the other a positively-charged anode. Electrons flow from the one to the other by way of the electrolyte. The two metals act as a battery and transfer electrons from one(the cathode) to the other(the anode).</p>

<p>When selecting fasteners <b>do not mix metals shown as red or yellow in the following chart</b>. The following chart shows the safety or danger of mixing metals:</p>

<h2 id='cleaning_products'><a href='cleaning_products.html'>cleaning products</a></h2><p>When it comes to cleaning, polishing or abrading, you don't need a crazy arsenal of products. Below is a list of recommendations for household cleaning, or maintenance aboard a boat.</p>
<table class='col' border='1'>
    <tr>
        <td><b>All purpose cleaner</b></td>
        <td>Mix of 500 ml hydrogen peroxide(3%) with 2.5 ml(40 drops) of lavender and lemon essential oils, and 0.6 ml(10 drops) of peppermint essential oil. Leave on surface for several minutes before wiping clean. Store in a dark-coloured bottle.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Chrome</b></td>
        <td>Apply apple cider vinegar on a soft cotton cloth to rub it clean. Then, use a fresh cloth with a dab of baby oil to make it shine.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Copper</b></td>
        <td>Make a paste of either lemon or lime juice and salt. Rub gently to clean.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Aluminum</b></td>
        <td>Cream of tartar and hot water. In a dish, add a few spoonfuls of cream of tartar, and stir in water to create a thick paste. Rub over the aluminum surface with a soft cloth.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Acrylic</b></td>
        <td>Use a mild dish soap. Mix about 1 L of water with a few drops of dish soap in a bowl, agitate to create suds. Dip cloth into mix, clean acrylic gently. Wipe with a clean, damp rag, and follow up with a soft, dry rag to collect leftover moisture.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Plastic</b></td>
        <td>Use a mixture of 1:2 white vinegar and warm water.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Brass</b></td>
        <td>Coat the cut half of the lemon with table salt and rub it over the surface, re-coating the lemon with salt as needed. Buff to a shine with a clean, dry cloth.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Cast iron</b></td>
        <td>Immediately after use, clean with plain hot water and a sponge. Stuck on food can be removed with a paste made of coarse salt and water. Dry with a towel, or over the oven at a low flame, and coat with a layer of oil.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Stainless steel</b></td>
        <td>Wipe down with freshwater, or use a mild soap solution and warm water for tough stains.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Fibreglass</b></td>
        <td>Dislodge debris with a scrubbing brush, rinse off with fresh water. For rust stains, make a paste of baking soda and water. Use a soft cloth and gently rub mixture onto the stain. Leave for 1 hour. For heavy yellow waterline and rust stains try Grunt emer-gel, a phosphoric acid-based product. Wear gloves while using it, as it is an irritant.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Wood dishes</b></td>
        <td>Wash with mild soap and warm water. Dry immediately after washing. Never soak in water or put it away wet. Every month, apply a coat of food-grade oil (we use coconut) to keep the wood moisturized.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Wood cutting boards</b></td>
        <td>Same basic treatment as wood dishes. Before adding oil, scrub clean with lemon and salt. Sprinkle board with coarse salt. Using a lemon half, cut side down, scour the surface. Let sit for 5 minutes, scrape mixture away, rinse clean and let air dry.</td>

        <td><b>Sink clog</b></td>
        <td>Pour 120 ml or more of baking soda down the drain, then add 250 ml of vinegar. Plug it up, and let it sit 10-15 min, then pour more hot water down. Repeat until clear.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Clothes</b></td>
        <td>Mix 2 cups of washing soda with the gratings from one 140 g bar of castile soap. Use 15 g for light loads, and 30 g for heavy loads. To whiten, disinfect, deodorize clothes of dish cloths, use sodium percarbonate at a ratio of 15 g per 5 L.</td>

<p>We prefer not to have too many overly specialized tools that we only ever use once every 3 years, like a rivet gun, a grease gun or a swage tool. In a boatyard, there is always someone who will have these, and we're certain that they'll be more than happy to lend them to you.</p>

<p><b>Bike tool essentials:</b></p>

<p>Note that we have single speed bikes, no derailleurs, so that simplifies things a little bit. We chose leaner bikes because we knew we'd be taking the wheels on and off often, and because it makes for a lighter bike(ours are aluminum) to store onboard.</p>

	<li>Spare tubes (check valve length and your wheel diameter)</li>
	<li>Floor pump with gauge (always fill at recommended PSI written on tire, otherwise you run the risk of getting punctured more easily)</li>
	<li>Hex wrench set (that fit all the hardware on your bike, for adjusting seat, pedals, wheels, etc)</li>
	<li>Open end wrenches (that fit the hardware on your bike)</li>
	<li>Tube patch kit</li>
	<li>Chain breaker (for when removal is necessary for cleanup)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many more tools to get if you wish to do a full bike tune-up, but in all these tools are way fine for most people, and it is what we carry onboard <a href='pino.html' class='local'>pino</a>.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Keep some old bike tubes, they are useful for self-steering a boat at sea (instead of using bungees). We used them a lot on long ocean passages because we didn't have a windvane, or an autopilot. See <b>Thoughts, Tips and Tactics for Singlehanded Sailing</b> by Andrew Evans for more information on steering a boat with bungees (or bike tubes).</p>

<p><b>Do the bikes rust?</b> No, our bikes don't rust, the frames are aluminum(forks are carbon) and we keep the steel chains and hubs well-oiled(3 in 1 oil). Always apply lube to a dry chain.</p>

<p><b>Where do you keep your bikes?</b>. When in port for a long time, we keep them outside, locked to a strong point on the boat. When we move the boat, or during the winter/rainy season, we stow them inside. We stow the bikes inside in either the v-berth, or quarter berth. The best way to stow them is to take both wheels off, to remove the pedals, turn the handle bars sideways, and to tie all components with straps. We cover the bikes with a bike bag.</p>

<p>The bags are nothing special, but allowed us to carry them with us <a href='../media/content/inventory/bikes_04.jpg' target='_blank'>aboard trains</a> while in Japan.</p>


<h2 id='hauling_out'><a href='hauling_out.html'>hauling out</a></h2><img src='../media/content/knowledge/haulingout.jpg' loading='lazy' />

<p>Tasks like hauling-out (to get the bottom painted) is once every 2-3 years for an offshore boat, but can be every year otherwise. How often you haul out depends on your personal preference.</p>

<p>When out of the water, don't forget to...</p>

<ul>
    <li>Check your cutlass bearing (push up on the prop to see if there is any play, there shouldn't be).</li>
    <li>Grease the inside of your prop with calcium sulfonate(No. 130-AA) if you have a Max Prop.</li>
    <li>Replace the boat zincs (shaft, hull(if any)).</li>
    <li>Replace or service your shaft seal. Dripless types need to be replaced out of the water, because it is necessary to undo the engine coupling to pull back the shaft to remove, and insert a new bellow(see <a href='propeller_maintenance.html' class='local'>propeller maintenance</a> to see our dripless seal replacement).</li>
    <li>Check the hull for blisters.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Bottom paint:</b> If we want to wait longer between haul-outs we paint more coats (2-3), otherwise 1 every year. We use ablative anti-fouling. Ablative wears out over time and when it does it will become less effective at repelling sea critters. Eventually, stripping the bottom of all paint down to the gelcoat is necessary, paint can build up and the older layers will start to flake off, making it difficult for new paint to adhere to the bottom. If painting the bottom from gel coat, adding a layer of primer is necessary so that the antifouling paint can adhere.</p>

<p><b>Strut and prop</b>: Coating your prop and strut with PropSpeed (see image below) works well to keep growth off, it works well in high-growth areas (we used it in New Zealand and Japan) but it is very expensive. Sailors often buy the product to share with others (helps keep costs down). There are also zinc-based sprays, or paint, that work quite well. See <a href='propeller_maintenance.html' class='local'>propeller maintenance</a> if you want advice on maintaining a feathering propeller.</p>

<p>If your boat comes out of the water for a haul-out every year, a cheap alternative is to coat metal with zinc cream(penanten) or anhydrous lanolin (reported by others). Both products are available at the pharmacy. Note that it doesn't last very long.</p>
