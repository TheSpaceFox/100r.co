<h1>galley plumbing</h1><p><b>19.04.04<br>Whangarei, New Zealand.</b></p>

<p>In Canada, and all the way down to Mexico, we were using our salt water pump in the galley, and unfortunately, in warmer waters, it caused the inside of the sink drains to corrode. We had to replace those, but removing the drains meant disconnecting the pipes below, which in turn revealed some pretty nasty stuff.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/galleyplumbing_01.jpg' />
<p>The pipes were clogged, and old - overall disgusting. So. What started as a drain-replacing project, turned into a galley sink overhaul. We spent much time at <b>Mitre10</b>, laying pipes out on the floor, to find the right-sized elbows and tubes.</p>

<p>"Okay. Drain head, goes to the lock joint, which goes to the tube, upsized to another, bigger joint, to another tube, to an elbow, to another tube..."</p>

<p>We had a nice puzzle thing going on, an exploded view of our future sink setup. Employees in the store stood around us, helping us find the correct parts.</p>

<p>Passing pliable pipes through floors and narrow gaps is always tough. We taped the end of the pipe to the new one and pulled, hoping it wouldn't come apart in the process. Do it slow, so slow, otherwise you're FUCKED. Being gentle and patient is a common tactic when it comes to boat projects.</p>

<p>We also replaced the galley faucet. The boat had a pressure faucet before, but we didn't use it, because we prefer to use the foot pump—more economical you see. Every press is a 1/4 cup of water. We removed the pressure faucet, as well as the old foot pump faucet that came through inside the sink (which had also begun to leak). We installed our new faucet head between the two sinks, in the place of the old one, and plugged up the hole the foot pump faucet left behind. We opted for a simple model, because the more extravagant, heavy duty one with a pumping handle didn't fit in that space vertically—shame (see update below).</p>

<p>Our sink is now equipped with a Fynspray WS-62 brass hand pump! The pump came off an old boat, and was sold to us at a very good price. We were looking for a durable replacement to our baby foot pump, it was leaking badly during our trip across the <a href='north_pacific_ocean.html' class='local'>north pacific ocean</a> and the new models did not fit our pedals. The hand pump doesn't draw out too much water, and looks very good.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: If used infrequently, the leather plunger washer can dry out and make it difficult to pump. This is why the company has released a conversion kit for a nitrile washer that won't dry out. To replace a leather cup washer version, buy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Conversion kit WS62/22 (brass valve seat and backing washer)</p>
<li>Service Kit WS62/17A (nitrile washer)</p>
</ul>

<p>We noticed our pump didn't have a lot of suction, we attributed this to a bad plunger washer(and we were right), but we took too long to change it and because we did, it caused some stress on the pin keeping the handle and pump lever together and it broke. Finding a replacement pin isn't a big deal, but the stress did cause the hole to stretch (we'll have to keep an eye on that).</p>

<p>We only took the pump apart once, 2 years prior, and we weren't sure how to take it apart again without damaging it but we found instructions online on how to do it:</p>

<p>To replace the plunger washer, it is necessary to unscrew the spout body & spout assembly from the barrel assembly. (As sealant has been used on the thread, run the spout body under hot water and then tap it gently with a soft-headed mallet or a piece of soft wood. Place the pump vertically in a bench vice, gripping the barrel assembly below the flange.) DO NOT use too much force on the spout & DO NOT use any tools as they may cause damage to the barrel. The complete handle & plunger assembly can now be removed. By holding the plunger valve body in a bench vice, the valve seat can be unscrewed, enabling the leather (or nitrile) cup washer to be replaced.</p>

<p>Since we don't have a replacement pin, we've put a chopstick in there temporarily :).</p>

<p>The old plunger washer was indeed, very old. Our pump came with a service kit with an extra leather washer so we used that, but we'll have to buy a conversion kit for future servicing since this kind is no longer in circulation.</p>

<p>To add felt packing under the gland nut, we cut a bit of hose and made another cut lenghtwise, this works well to push the packing in evenly. This is the same technique used for adding packing on a shaft seal. Unfortunately, the bit of packing that came with our service kit wasn't felt... and it comes apart when we tried to use the pump. We bought this pump from someone else, so it's possible that they put some other kind of packing in the bag (the bag with the replacement parts was half opened and old) along with the leather plunger washer. We'll have to find a replacement.</p>
