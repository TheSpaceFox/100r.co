<h1>chainplates</h1><p><b>2024.03.04<br>Victoria, BC</b>.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/chainplates_01.jpg' alt='the starboard side forward chain plate pulled halfway out of the deck' loading='lazy' />

<p>Despite owning Pino for 8 years, there are still parts we've never removed, or seen. This year we plan on cruising in Northern BC and decided to pull the boat's chainplates to see if they needed replacing.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/chainplates_02.jpg' style='float:left;' class='medium' />
<p>Yamaha 33's (with the engine in the stern), have very long chainplates that go the deck at four points.</p>

<p>Each plate is secured to a cabin bulkhead with two beefy bolts, and then secured to a stainless steel plate that is embedded(fibreglasses) in the hull. The chainplates are sandwiched between two thick slabs, and through-bolted.It's hard to get a good look at what is securing the chainplates to the hull, but we used a mirror to show what it looks like. There is a lot of surface rust, but the metal appeared fine once all of the grime and dust was removed. <img src='../media/content/boat_projects/chainplates_05.jpg' style='float:right;' class='medium' /></p>

<p>Each plate is secured to a cabin bulkhead with two beefy bolts, and then secured to a stainless steel plate that is embedded(fibreglassed) in the hull. The bottom of the chainplates are sandwiched between two thick slabs(both part of one heavy piece of stainless steel), and through-bolted. It's hard to get a good look at what is securing the chainplates to the hull, but we used a mirror to show what it looks like. There is a lot of surface rust, but the metal appeared fine once all of the grime and dust was removed.</p>

<p>To remove the chainplates, we tied 3 halyards on each side to keep the mast balanced, removed all of the cotter pins, loosened the turnbuckles attached to each chainplate, and removed the backing plate and the sealant where the chainplate enters the hull. Pulling on it by hand wasn't enough to get it out. We tied our whisker pole halyard to the end and winched it out.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/chainplates_04.jpg' alt='a cleaned up chainplate' loading='lazy' />

<p>The first chainplate looked much better after a good clean-up, but unfortunately, this revealed a bit of pit corrosion around one of the upper bolt holes (common for boats that age). The others also had the same problem, and one of them seemed to have a small crack near one of the welding points.</p>

<p>If a length of SS exhibits pit corrosion on the surface, it is an indicator that the corrosion goes deep into the metal, and a crack is just not a good thing overall. Stainless Steel is very resistant to corrosion, but can rust when there moisture and no oxygen(a common issue for chainplates that lie tight onto bulkheads and that are sealed at the deck to prevent water intrusion).</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/chainplates_03.jpg' alt='a close up of pitting near one of the bolt holes' loading='lazy' />

<p><b>Yamaha 33 chainplates</b>: The two cap shroud and two intermediate shroud chainplates are straight flat SS bars, 1.22m (4 ft) in length. The two lower shroud chainplates are a bit longer, and the top of the flat bar has a slight bend and an angle. All of the chainplates are thicker(8 mm | 5/16 in) at the top and bottom, and thinner(6.35 mm | 4/16 in) in the middle. An extra piece of SS was welded at both ends to add strength, and the rest was left thin to save on weight.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't think it'll be possible to re-install 8 mm chainplates, because no supplier in town carries flat bars with metric measurements. We'll likely have to size up to 9.5 mm. Sizing up may mean having to enlargen some holes... but we'll see. In any case, sizing up is better than sizing down.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 6th we took a bus up to Canoe Cove and dropped off our chainplates for fabrication(they use the old ones as templates). We thought about making the chainplates ourselves, but we don't have the right tools to do the work. One of our chainplates has an angle, not something we can replicate. We expect everything to cost somewhere between 1000-1500$CAD. Offloading this task will permit us to focus on repairing the wet core about the chainplate holes.</p>

<p>For the wet core, we did nothing special. We removed a lot of the wet wood, as much as we could, and then let them dry out. We were lucky, the weather had been awful these past few weeks, but we got one good week of sunny summer-like weather. Once the wood appeared dry, we filled the edges of the hole with thickened epoxy. Later the next day, we enlargened all of the holes for the chainplate backing plate, and poured runny epoxy inside all 4 holes. Then the next day, we scuffed up the surface and added thickened epoxy to level the holes. <b>Note</b>: Had we not been in a marina, we would have considered removing the top part of the deck and inserting a new marine ply core. We can't do that kind of work here, the marina will kick us out... and so we did as little epoxy work as we could, while making the space solid. Either way, we would have epoxied the walls of the chainplate hole, leaving bare wood there was a big design flaw.</p>

<p>With the chainplates off the boat, Devine went to work removing the starboard side cabinet to see what the back wall looked like (we've never seen that part of Pino before).</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/chainplates_07.jpg' alt='' loading='lazy' />

<p>Devine was looking forward to removing it to repair it, because overtime the screws holding the front and back together got bent, half of them were halfway out of their holes. The cabinet seemed secure despite that, but it was a cause of concern.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/chainplates_06.jpg' alt='' loading='lazy' />

<p>We plan to replace some of the cabinet wood, and to replace many of the screws.</p>

<p>Now back to the chainplates!</p>

<p>We were a bit nervous about not having any of the starboard and port side chainplates supporting the mast There isn't too much wave action in the marina, but we did have a few gales. We had a day of 45-50 knots from the SE in the inner harbour. Our mast is keel-stepped, and it was well-secured(5 halyards, with backstay and headstay still on), but it was still worrisome to have big weather while missing solid mast support. All of the supporting halyards were attached on the toe rail at various points, we ran a line through various holes and attached the supporting lines to this to spread out the load.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/chainplates_08.jpg' alt='an image showing the newly fabricated and shiny chainplates compared to the old ones' loading='lazy' />

<p>We went to pick up our new chainplates on the 28th of March. The total cost was 1130$ (400$ for the material and around 600$ for the labour). The fabricator replicated the look of our old chainplates, minus the welding, with an added thickness of 1.5 mm. No one in B.C. stocks metric metal bars, so upsizing is the way to go.</p>

<p>Our lovely friend Julia gave us a ride to pick up the new bits of metal, we thought it unsafe to carry them back by bus(unsafe for the other passengers, the new bars were much heavier and we were carrying the old ones too).</p>

<p>As expected, we had to widen the existing holes on deck-not a problem. We also had to cut away some of the wood to allow them to pass through the cabin. We were concerned that the thicker plates wouldn't fit inside the metal sandwhich glassed into the hull, but we were able to work it in. The whole work was without any drama. Nope, we're lying. While installing the starboard side cap and intermediate shroud chainplate we noticed that the hole in the bulkhead didn't align with the hole in the metal. We wondered for a moment if the fabricator had made a mistake, but then we looked at our original chainplates and saw that they weren't identical. We had assumed that they were. The bottom-most hole for the starboard side chainplate is off-center. Because we hadn't notice, we put them in the wrong way... our mistake was evident when we saw that the bulkhead holes didn't align. So we took them out again, swapped them, and everything was fine and merry!</p>

<p>Well, kind of. When inserting the lower shroud chainplate on the port side we had to remove the aluminum track in the pilot berth. Because the chainplates are thickner, they couldn't get past the aluminum. Removing this track wasn't a problem, we weren't using it. Even the previous owners had installed another way to keep the space closed that didn't rely on this track. The only thing this track was good at was gathering dust.</p>
