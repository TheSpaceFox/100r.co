<h1>solar cooking experiment</h1>
<p><b>2023.11.30<br>Salish Sea</b></p>

<img src='../media/content/blog/solar_cooker_deck.jpg' title='solar cooked sitting on the bow of a boat' loading='lazy'>

<h3>A summer of solar cooking</h3>

<p>In the spring of 2023 we learned about <a href='solar_evacuated_tube_cooking.html' class='local'>solar evacuated tube cooking</a>, an efficient way of preparing food with the sun. We spent our first summer experimenting with such a cooker, in which we learned to plan our meals with the weather.</p>

<div class='notice'><b>A note on local conditions:</b><br>We tested the solar cooker while in the Salish Sea, where summer daytime temperatures range from 12-32°C. We also experimented in 5°C temperatures.</div>

<p>We prioritized the use of the solar cooker when preparing foods with long cooking times, like brown rice, beans, potatoes, seitan, cake and bread. It would have been possible to prepare all parts of a meal with the solar cooker, but we didn't want it to become a ball and chain, keeping us onboard all day. Solar cooking isn't terribly demanding, but it requires some attention.</p>

<p>On days of full sun, we could cook one full meal. In the morning(0900-1000) we'd prepare chickpeas, then bake bread in the afternoon(anytime between 1300-1700). On days of half-sun we'd cook food with quick-cooking times like white rice, brown lentils, potatoes or seitan. On very rainy/overcast days solar cooking was not possible.</p>

<p>If planning to cook foods with long wait times, such as bread(needs time to rise), or beans(needs soaking), we would check the forecast to make sure the next day's weather would permit it. If there was sun, we'd pre-soak the beans or pre-mix the dough before bed so everything would be ready to cook come morning.</p>

<img src='../media/content/blog/solar_baguette2.jpg' title='solar cooked baguette' loading='lazy'>

<q>The closer the sun gets to the horizon, the harder it is to find a good angle for the cooker, which is why it is better to prepare meals in the morning or in the early afternoon.</q>

<p>We liked to place the cooker on the bow, on the space above the anchor locker just ahead of the forward hatch.</p>

<p>That space is relatively flat, which keeps the cooker leveled and prevents spills (if cooking beans, before they have time to soak in the cooking water). On a rounded-surface, the cooker can rock.</p>

<img src='../media/content/blog/solar_cooker_deck3.jpg' title='solar cooked sitting on the bow of a boat' loading='lazy'>

<h3>When is the food ready?</h3>

<p>Cooking times on a very sunny day resemble those from cooking on a stovetop(or in an oven), without using a pressure cooker. A half-cake recipe cooks in about 30 minutes, a baguette takes an hour, a 1/2 cup of pre-soaked black beans takes 1-1h30 hours, etc.</p>

<P>The reason the cooking time is comparable is because the tray can't hold a lot of food. Our tube is sized for two people.<p>

<p>1 cup of pre-soaked chickpeas was the max quantity for a solar tube with an inner diameter of 5.5cm(17in). The tube can only accommodate half bread or cake recipes(we cook them in two batches one right after the other, see details below).</p>

<p><b>Your nose knows best</b>. In the summer Pino's forward hatch is always open, and because a boat at anchor points in the wind the breeze carries the smell of the cooking food inside. The smell emanating from the bow is a clear indication of whether or not the meal is ready.<p>

<p>We began to rely on our noses instead of looking at the time. Time doesn't mean much when solar cooking because sun cookers don't put out a constant heat like a traditional oven, the temperature inside the tube changes depending on cloud coverage, or if the boat(and the cooker) move out of alignment for too long.</p>

<h3>Obstacles to cooking</h3>

<img src='../media/content/travel/roscoe_bay_03.jpg' title='Pino stern-tied to shore in Roscoe Bay, with the sun already below the treeline' loading='lazy'>

<p><b>Land obstructions</b>. When anchored in bays that are surrounded by tall mountains the sun sets early, cutting down on permissible cooking hours. When Pino is stern-tied to a tree, or to a rock face, it is like being on land, the boat is still and it's easier to set the cooker, but proximity to land means that it will eventually cast a shadow.</p>

<p>When stern-tied in <a href='roscoe_bay.html' class='local'>Roscoe Bay</a> the sun fell behind the tree line we were tied to at around 1700 everyday. Boats tied to the opposite side of the bay had more sun in evenings but in the morning would have to wait for the sun to rise above the tree line.</p>

<p><b>Windy days</b>. On a windy day a boat will yaw and swing, causing the cooker to come out of alignment with the sun, but we found that it always returns to the same position and that it didn't alter the cooking time too much.</p>

<p>We have cooked food on the bow in near-gale(see<a href='beaufort_scale.html' class='local'>beaufort scale</a>) without any issues, although we liked to place stoppers(shoes, or ropes) at the foot of the cooker. With food in the tray the cooker becomes bottom heavy and won't tip easily, even when the reflectors are near-vertical, but we preferred to add stoppers or to tie short lengths of rope to it just so we wouldn't have to think about it. Evidently, cooking in anything more than a near-gale is a bit foolhardy.</p>

<p><b>Calm days</b>. Cooking on a calm day, or when the wind was unstable, was challenging because the boat's position was ever changing. On a calm day a boat "walks" around its anchor on the seafloor(this movement is worse with an all-rope rode, the weight of all-chain restricts the radius a bit more). The wake from a passing boat or dinghy was often enough to push the boat into a new position, which meant having to re-adjust the cooker constantly. On calm days, solar cooking occupied more of our time because of the constant re-aligning.</p>

<p><b>Shadows</b>. While keeping the solar cooker on the bow was the best spot, there were still parts of our boat that would create significant shade, slowing the cooking speed. We had moments when the wind direction kept the boat in line with the sun with the furling headsail casting a big shadow on the cooker. Other times the sun was behind the boat with the mast in the way.</p>
<p>We've experimented with placing the cooker in the cockpit, but that too was tricky because depending on the time of day, the sun would be too low and then the bimini too became a problem. No part of our boat is 100% dependable at all times, but in all, we found the bow to be the most reliable spot.</p>  

<h3>Dry foods can burn fast</h3>

<img src='../media/content/blog/ya_burnt.jpg' title='slightly burned sunflower seeds' loading='lazy'>

<p>Some foods, like coffee beans and sunflower seeds, require careful monitoring.</p>

<p>On a sunny day the temperature would rise quickly and burn the dry beans and seeds. Our noses would tell us when the cooker got to temperature, after which we would check on the food every 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>Roasting coffee with the sun</h3>

<p>Yes. It works. Our friend Cathos gave us a bag of green coffee beans and we decided to try roasting them in the solar cooker.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, it requires constant monitoring, but it is worth the extra attention.</p>

<img src='../media/content/blog/solar_coffee.jpg' title='coffee beans roasted in a solar cooker' loading='lazy'>

<p>The first batch was too light, but the second was just right(we prefer dark roasts).</p>

<img src='../media/content/blog/solar_coffee_ground.jpg' title='coffee beans ground up in a moka pot' loading='lazy'>

<p>Roasting coffee beans in a solar cooker is a very joyous, but terribly distracting experience. It is difficult to focus on work with the smell of freshly-roasted beans wafting through the cabin.</p>

<img src='../media/content/blog/solar_fresh_coffee.jpg' title='a fresh cup of solar-cooked coffee' loading='lazy'>

<p>That first cup of freshly-roasted coffee was very good.</p>

<h3>High temperatures</h3>

<img src='../media/content/blog/temp.jpg' title='an electronic read-out of the temperature inside a solar cooker on a sunny day reading 216C/420F' loading='lazy'>

<p>Our friend Josh lent us his electronic temperature reader so we could measure the heat inside of the tube on a sunny summer day. The above temperature(216°C/420°F) was measured in early June at around 1100.</p>
 
<p>The solar cooker's outer tube is cold to the touch, but the inside tray can get dangerously warm. One day we dropped the end of the cooking tray on Rek's leg and it left a very bad burn. We like to keep oven mitts outside when cooking, so we can lay the tray on it when the food is done, or if we need to stir/flip items in it.</p>

<h3>Baking with the sun</h3>

<img src='../media/content/blog/solar_baguette.jpg' title='a solar-cooked baguette' loading='lazy'>

<p><b>Using parchment paper when baking</b>. When cooking bread we prepared full recipes but would cut the dough in two and cook them separately so the bread would not expand too much in the tube. If food expands too much it can get stuck. When making bread, or cake, we always line the tray with parchment paper, with the paper curling over the contents of the tray, so that the dough won't stick to anything.</b>

<p>Bread takes about 2 hours total, 1 hour per baguette, with each baguette flipped every 30 minutes(one end of the cooker cooks at higher temperatures than the other).</p>

<img src='../media/content/blog/solar_cake2.jpg' title='solar-cooked chocolate chip cake' loading='lazy'>

<p>A cake can take 1 hour total for a full "tube cake" recipe, 30 minutes per cake. To cook a cake we line the tray with parchment paper and spoon in the uncooked batter evenly overtop. Getting the cake out without breaking it(due to it being a long thin tube) is difficult, but possible, it helps to flop it onto a cutting board or dish matching the length of the tray.</p>

<h3>Cleaning the tube</h3>

<p>We did not use the cooker to reheat pasta sauce, which could splash and encrust the inside of the tube. Cleaning the tube isn't too bothersome, but it is more challenging than cleaning a bowl (a human arm can't find inside it).</p>

<p>If the tube is encrusted with dried bean juice, or pasta sauce, and that food is cooked into it again, the tray may be difficult to pull out because it is a tight, tight fit, and trapped food further restricts that space.</p>

<p>After cooking beans we would wet the inside of the tube thoroughly, and then use a special brush(that screws onto the end of the tray) to clean it. When there was a lot of dirt, we would turn the tray from side to side so that its edges could scrape it away.</p>

<p>We try not to do full turns with the tray so as to not accidentally unscrew the brush and have it get stuck in the tube.</p>

<h3>Advantages</h3>

<p><b>Keeps heat outside</b>. It keeps unwanted heat outside in the summer. Using a pressure cooker inside steams up the boat. We only used the pressure cooker once this summer, as opposed to using it every 2 days(like in the winter).</p>

<p><b>Reduces use of LPG</b>. On a sunny day we don't have to worry about running out of fuel, the solar cooker can run as long as there is sun.<br>When the season was over, we found that our LPG tank still had plenty of fuel. Usually, we go through a 20lbs tank in 4-5 months.</p>

<p><b>Security</b>. We had issues with the controller for our tank solenoid this summer and had to bypass it entirely to cook with our LPG stove. Whenever we wanted to cook, we had to go outside to open the propane tank valve, and we would go back outside to close it after use(for safety's sake). This was a breakage that didn't prevent us from cooking, but other things can happen, having a cooker that isn't gas or power-reliant we found was a good security.</p>

<h3>Failures?</h3>

<p>The only food we couldn't cook in the solar cooker was soybeans. Soybeans have a very long cooking time, and they make a great big mess. We left them for 2 hours once with no apparent end in sight. After that, we decided it wasn't worth it and instead continued to cook other beans like black beans, and kidney beans(chickpeas and lentils also cook well in the solar cooker).</p>

<h3>Securing the cooker while sailing</h3>

<img src='../media/content/blog/solar_securing_cooker.jpg' title='solar cooker hanging on a sailboat wall' loading='lazy'>

<p>Evacuated solar tubes are made of strong borosilicate glass, but can still shatter. We installed two stainless steel hooks on the inside of the anchor locker in the v-berth, and hung the cooker there during transits.</p>

<p>We prefer not to leave the cooker outside when it is not in use.</p>

<h3>What we cooked in it</h3>

<p>As mentionned previously, we found the solar cooker to be most useful when preparing foods with long-cooking times.</p>

<p>This summer we cooked: <br>Black beans, kidney beans, brown lentils, bread, chocolate cake, chocolate chip cake, beets, potatoes, seitan, coffee(roasted green beans), sunflower seeds, calrose brown rice, chickpeas, etc...</p>

<p>We look forward to experimenting with it again next summer.</p>
