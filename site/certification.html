<h1>certification</h1><p>You can get a boat without experience (like we did), but in Canada you need a couple of things first.</p>
<p>1. <b>Pleasure Craft Operator Card</b>. The test is easy, and covers the basic safety regulations, as well as buoyage. You can do the test online, and the card will be shipped to you afterwards. This test makes sure that you understand how to recognize different buoys, how to navigate alongside other boats etc.</p>
<p>2. <b>A ROC certificate</b> (radio operator's certificate). You need this to be able to operate a marine VHF radio. Check your area for ROC courses, it costs about 100$ per person. You can buy the manuals and study at home, then take the test on a scheduled date with an examiner. The test is a multiple choice written exam, and includes a few verbal questions about radio calling (need to learn <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet' target='_blank' class='external'>Nato Phonetic Alphabet</a>). You have to take this test, otherwise you won't be permitted to transmit on the radio (you can technically, but you will be in the wrong). Knowing how to talk on a VHF radio is important, especially if you've had an accident and need help.</p>
<p>3. <b>Security gear</b>. Even if you're just going for a short outing with your boat, you need to get basic safety gear, like lifejackets (one for every person aboard), a medical kit, a PLB or EPIRB, good <a href='sailing.html#ground_tackle'>ground tackle</a> etc.</p>
<p>4. <b>Changing your boat name</b>. First of all, ignore whatever anyone tells you about it being bad luck. Having a name that means something to you is important. In Canada, changing your boat name will cost you 250$ and the wait time varies, it can take 1-2 months. You can visit <a href='http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety/oep-vesselreg-registration-menu-2311.htm' target='_blank' class='external'>Transport Canada</a> for information on how to do it. They will send you a certificate of registry, this piece of paper is very important. You will have to show it to customs whenever you're entering a new country by boat. The certificate expires about a few years, but they will send you a new one free of charge.</p>
