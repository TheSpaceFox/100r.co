<h1>insulation</h1><p><b>21.07.15<br>North Saanich BC, Canada</b></p>

<p>We have largely avoided winter these past 5 years, having instead chosen to follow summer around the Pacific. This was a good plan, we think. But we have since returned to Canada, a place not known for its tropical weather.</p>

<p>In the winter of 2020-2021, we woke up one morning with 2 feet of snow on deck. "Ah," we thought, "it snows here too." We cannot tell you why we thought there couldn't be snow here. We stayed in Victoria, the southernmost place in British Columbia, but apparently not south enough.</p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/victoria_snow01.jpg' alt='a photo of a sailboat buried in snow' title='snow on deck' loading='lazy'>

<p>Armed with a new understanding of local weather, and two electric heaters, we kept Pino warm, but certain areas of the boat suffered because of condensation. While in <a href='new_zealand.html' class='local'>new zealand</a> we insulated the v-berth, badly. Shoddy, shoddy work. Our walls resembled a mountain face in Nuku Hiva after a big rain. We had used camping mats made of 1 cm EVA foam with a foil backing. We had glued it with a spray adhesive. It helped a little, but the glue was not applied correctly, and we had not cleaned the wall underneath it well enough either.</p>

<p>This year we are determined not to have a repeat of the winter of 2020-2021.</p>

<p>We installed a <a href='woodstove.html' class='local'>woodstove</a> in the main saloon. Wood stoves give off good, dry heat which should help keep the boat warm when we are off-grid. We also made <a href='curtains.html' class='local'>curtains</a> for our windows. Pino's windows are very large, and a significant source of heat loss. Next on our list is insulation important, and accessible parts of the boat.</p>

<p>Insulating a boat while it still has walls, floors and ceilings is an impossible job. We are not aiming for perfection, because perfection involves tearing the boat to pieces, but we will do our best to deal with exposed surfaces. In all though, the very best way to avoid condensation is <b>ventilation</b>.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/vberth_insulation_03.jpg' alt='rekka cleaning glue off bare fibreglass with acetone' title='cleaning glue off with acetone' loading='lazy'>

<p>We tore the old insulation off, and found that some came away with little mess or effort—a bad sign that our first installation was indeed shoddy. We scraped off the glue, and cleaned the rest off with acetone. We instead re-used the sheets of EVA foam to insulate our lockers.</p>

<p>Then, we epoxied a series of wooden strips to create a scaffolding along the hull. We found this wood in the workshop of the local sailing club. People leave scrap wood from projects, good wood, and now it is ours. We plan to paint the wood with a thin layer of epoxy, so that mold can't reach our precious material. We had to make a lot of thickened epoxy to fill gaps between the wooden strips and the hull.</p>

<p>Our boat has a bulge in the center of the wall, running from bow to stern. Apparently, this is to reinforce the hull. Handy. We removed the trim that was there previously, and plan to re-use it after adding the new upholstery. The bulge would be useful, we can use it to 'frame' the insulation.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/vberth_insulation_01.jpg' title='scaffolding' alt='a photo of the v-berth with wooden scaffolding along the hull, and a view of the bad resin' loading='lazy'>

<p>For this project we alternated between fancy, and so-so resin. One dried quickly, the other slowly, and its smell lingered in the cabin for days and days. West Systems resin is not cheap, but it is very good, and we regret trying the cheaper variety.</p>

<p>Next, came time to choose our insulation material. We chose Foamular, or XPS(extruded polystyrene). Foamular is pink, with a line drawing of the pink panther overtop.</p>

<p><b>2022 UPDATE —</b> some studies have shown that contrary to what XPS manufacturers report, XPS <a href='https://www.airfoam.com/EPS-vs-XPS-Foam-Insulation.php' target='_blank'>can lose its effectiveness over time</a> (due to off-gassing) and can <a href='https://info.ornl.gov/sites/publications/files/Pub36100.pdf' target='_blank'>retain moisture if exposed for long periods</a>. When we researched insulation materials we relied on the information relayed by XPS manufacturers, but it is difficult to make decisions or to make product comparisons when companies understate the water permeability or overall performance of their products. We had not seen this prior to installing ours in 2021, despite having done plenty of research. At the time, using EPS as insulation was discouraged from a variety of sources, but it is possible that they too relied on false reportings from manufacturers, or companies with conflicts of interest. We will not be ripping out the XPS, we believe that it it making a difference (no more condensation in that space what-so-ever), but we will use it as a case study for the use of XPS on a boat. If we can get our hands on a moisture meter we'll be able to test this further, and we'll share our findings. Do your research, use XPS on your boat at your own risk. Thank you to <b>Lease</b> for telling us about this bit of information. <b>— End of update.</b></p>

<p>XPS is easy to find locally, this, its price, and high R-value per thickness is what inspired our choice. It has a R-value of 5 per 2.54 cm(inch), and it outperforms most other types of insulation, like Polyiso. Unlike Polyiso, XPS is less stiff and can follow curves better (depending on chosen thickness). The only thickness available to us was 2.54 cm (1 in), thicker than we wanted, but we think we can make it work. It might shrink the v-berth a bit, but we don't think this bothersome. Warmth is preferable to width(ha). We'll likely layer a thin material overtop, so the wall won't be much thicker than this.</p>

<h3>The work</h3>

<p>We measured each section we would have to cover with the foam boards, marked them up and cut shallow lines across its length and snapped the pieces right off.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/vberth_insulation_02.jpg' alt='a photo of foam boards laying over the walls of a vberth inside a sailboat' title='dry fit of foamular boards' loading='lazy'>

<p>Next step, is to affix the cut pieces to the wall. We bought some polyurethane adhesive (formula for foam boards), applied it to the back of the board and pressed it on firmly. We used mechanical support to press the board onto the wall while drying. We only have so many pieces of wood for support, so we are applying 3 at a time.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/vberth_insulation_04.jpg' alt='a photo of a variety of objects pressed onto glue foamb boards to help secure the foam to the wall' title='improvised weights' loading='lazy'>

<p>It took a few days to get all of the boards on.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/vberth_insulation_06.jpg' alt='a photo of rekka add spray foam in the cracks between the foam boards while wearing a protective suit and goggles' title='adding spray foam to cracks' loading='lazy'>

<p>Next step is to add foam spray to seal cracks between the scaffolding and foam boards. It is quite easy to use, but it makes a mess. At least, it is easy to trim. We posted the above picture on Twitter, and people made fun of our Chernobyl-esque accoutrement. It ain't nuclear waste, but it generates <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/isocyanates/default.html' target='_blank'>isocyanate vapors and aerosols</a>, a powerful irritant. It isn't good to breathe SPF during application, or to let it get on your skin(causes marked inflammation), and hey, we like not having asthma. Isocyanates can also sensitize you, making you subject to severe asthma attacks if you are exposed again. Always ventilate the space when applying SPF, and let it air out for a full 24 hours.</p>

<p>Our friends Rik and Kay drove us to Home Depot to pick up some carpeting. We picked up two 1.82 m(6 ft) by 2.43 m(7 ft) rolls. We plan to use that as finish for the walls. We thought of using vinyl flooring, but carpet is cheaper, and may provide more insulation. The carpet is for outdoor/indoor uses, are 100% polyester, and won't rot. Also, it's easy to cut and isn't too heavy. The vinyl flooring is nice but would add too much weight.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/vberth_insulation_05.jpg' title='our future wall covering' alt='rolls of carpet in a messy, messy cockpit' loading='lazy'>

<p>We trimmed the excess spray foam, and painted over with an acrylic latex paint. The foam isn't as waterproof when cut, so sealing it with something is necessary. Leaving the foam uncut would have been better, but then we would have very, very lumpy walls.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/vberth_insulation_07.jpg' alt='a photo of rekka painting over bits of cut foam insulation' title='painting over the insulation' loading='lazy'>

<p>We cut the carpet to match the shape of the wall, and laid on some outdoor carpet adhesive (Home Bond). We tooled adhesive on the whole surface, and pressed on the carpet.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/vberth_insulation_10.jpg' title='gluing the carpet to the wall' alt='rekka applying glue to the wall for the carpet' loading='lazy'>

<p>We also added the trim back on top, fixed on the fibreglass bulge lining the space. It looks amazing! We're so happy! The wall wasn't perfectly smooth prior to applying the carpet, but it barely shows.</p>

<p>The interlocking foam pads were there prior to the start of this project.</p>

<p>In the end, we didn't really use the scaffolding we'd built. At the time, we thought we'd use it to mount vinyl walls, but then we chose to lay on carpet. In any case, the scaffolding reinforces the wall, and if ever we decide to add shelving then we have something to use as backing.</p>

<p>20.10.20. So far, so good. No condensation under the cushions in the v-berth. It isn't as cold as it's going to be out there, but this time last year we had drippy walls and wet cushions.</p>
