<h1>solar tips</h1><p>Tips, info or tricks we learned along the way.</p>

<h3>Types of solar panels</h3>

<p><b>Monocrystalline.</b> Darker in color, each cell is cut from a single silicon crystal, they are more efficient overall. They yield the highest output while occupying less space, but do better in warm weather. Their lifespan is 25yrs. Available in hard and flexible form.</p>

<p><b>Polycrystalline.</b> Lighter, blue in color, the cells are composed of multiple, smaller crystals. They are less efficient than monocrystalline in lower light situations, but are cheaper to manufacture and therefore cheaper to buy. Available as hard panels.</p>

<p><b>Thin film</b>. Solid black in appearance, made by depositing a photovoltaic substance onto a solid smooth surface like glass. The four main substances are Amorphous Silicon, Cadmium Telluride, Copper Indium Gallium Selenide, and Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells, technically all different, they all fall under the category of thin film panels. They are less efficient, but cheap to produce. High temperatures and shading have less impact on these solar panels.</p>

<p><b>ETFE( Ethylene tetrafluoroethylene).</b> A fluorine-based plastic. ETFE were created to help make robust flexible panels. It was created with high corrosion resistance and is considered to have the same long life span as tempered glass when used in the solar industry. Unlike most flexible panels, it is less prone to cracking, delamination and corrosion.</p>

<p>Flexible panels make a lot of sense on a small boat because they're light, but unless they are ETFE don't bother, they will crack and deteriorate too quickly. See our <a href='solar.html' class='local'>solar</a> timeline to see what happened to ours.</p>

<h3>Deck installation</h3>

<p>Install hard panels with an air space underneath to permit the panel to cool down.</p>

<h3>Parallel wiring</h3>

<p>On a 12V system solar panels ought to be connected in parallel so the voltage stays the same. With panels in parallel, the amperage of each panel is added up, and the performance of one panel is not dependent on the performance of another. This is important on a boat because at one point or another, one of the panels will have shade from the mast, radar post, boom etc. Wiring panels in parallel requires a thicker wire gauge to accomodate higher passing current.</p>

<p>To wire multiple panels in parallel you'll need <b>MC4 branch connectors</b>, or T connectors.</p>

<p>In short, things to remember:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Voltage stays the same</li>
	<li>Amps are added up</li>
	<li>Can perform if one panel is partially shaded</li>
	<li>Thicker wiring</li>
	<li>Requires extra gear like branch connectors</li>
</ul>

<h3>Wire sizing</h3>

<p>When it comes to sizing wires, the smaller the number, the bigger the cable (counter-intuitive, we know).</p>

<p>Important to note that UL cables (AWG, American Wire Gauge) are larger than SAE (US versus European standards). Some wires will display wire thickness in mm or inches, to find out their AWG or SWG(Standard Wire Gauge) equivalent view <a href='https://www.engnetglobal.com/tips/wiregaugechart/' target='_blank'>this table</a>.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<ul>
	<li>2x100W panel</li>
	<li>at 17.40V</li>
	<li>10Amps</li>
	<li>Distance to controller is 15 ft</li>
</ul>

<p>A system like this will require a wire gauge of AWG 12.</p>

<p>Adding panels to a systems is easy with branch connectors, this is how you connect them in parallel. A 3-way branch connector accepts 2 wires, and combines them into one, so a connector with two positives become one positive, and the same applies to the negatives side and these two wires will connect to the solar controller.</p>

<p>With two panels, you add up the amps of each and requires a heavier wire gauge. It is possible to use smaller gauge wire from the panel to the branch connector (because it is still 5 amps each at that point), but you may have to use a thicker wire gauge from the connector to the controller if the combined amperage is too high and if the distance is too great.</p>

<p>To calculate the wiring gauge for your system, we recommend <a href='http://circuitwizard.bluesea.com/' target='_blank'>Circuit Wizard</a> by Blue Sea.</p>

<p>In all, distance and amperage matters.</p>

<h3>Solar controller</h3>

<p>To size a solar controller, add up the amperage from your current solar panels. Panels with combined amperage of 10 amps would require a 10-amp or 15-amp controller.</p>

<p>If you want to charge more than one battery bank, consider one with a dual charging function. Another option is to add an auxiliary charger to charge the other bank.</p>

<h3>Fuses</h3>

<p>If the controller doesn't go through a breaker panel, add a fuse between the solar panel and the controller, and between the controller and the battery (as close to the battery as possible). Fuses are sacrificial and protect your electrical components from damages caused by overcurrent. Breakers and fuses accomplish the same purpose, and can be used interchangeably.</p>

<p>To calculate the fuse size needed between the charge controller and battery bank match the amperage rating on the charge controller. For example, if you have a 15Amp charge controller use a 25Amp fuse.</p>

<p>To calculate the fuse size from the panel to the charge controller, add up the amperage of each panel and then add a 25% industry rule to figure out the fuse size.</p>

<p>For example, if you had 2x100W panels that each produces about 5 Amps, you would use this equation:</p>

<p><b>(2x5x1.25) = 12.5 Amps</b></p>

<p>In the above example you would need a 12.5 Amp fuse, and we'd recommend a 15 Amp fuse (next biggest number).</p>

<h3>Connecting panels with dissimilar voltage</h3>

<p>Connecting two panels with different voltages, you will get voltage to lower voltage. If one panel is 17.40V and the other 18V, when connected in parallel the voltage will drop to 17.40V.</p>

<h3>Formula to calculate the current in amps</h3>

<p>If you have a panel that is 190W at 17.40V, the solar controller will regulate it down to 12V, but the amperage between the controller and the battery will increase as a result. To know how much it will increase to size your wiring properly, you need to know how many amps will pass through it. To calcutate it use the formula below:</p>

<p>The current I in amps (A) is equal to the power P in watts (W), divided by the voltage V in volts (V):</p>

<p><b>I(A) = P(W) / V(V)</b></p>

<p>For the example panel above the formula would be:</p>

<p><b>190W / 17.40V = 15.83 Amps</b></p> 

<p>The wiring gauge between the controller and battery would need to accomodate 16 amps.</p>
