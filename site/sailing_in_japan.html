<p>Sailing to Japan was our dream, there was no amount of labyrinthine bureaucracy that could have deterred us from pursuing our goal.</p>

<p>The entry procedures are intimidating, but not too difficult, all it requires is patience. From a bureaucratic point of view, sailing to Japan is easier than it used to be since the instauration of a <a href='https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001420113.pdf'>cruising permit</a>[PDF, 168 KB] in 2019. Here is a collection of notes on entry procedures, the papers required for entry as well as information on provisioning, ports and more...</p>

<div class="notice">It is the nature of the internet for pages to move, or to disappear. We try to update links and information for sailing in Japan as much as possible, the last significant update to this page was done on April 6th 2024. If you find any dead links, let us know.</div>

<h2 id='entry_procedures'>entry procedures</h2>

<p>Before you even think of entering Japan by sailboat, there are many preparations to make. You must first decide on your <b>port of entry</b>. In Japan, any open port is a port of entry and can be used to clear into the country. You can view a list of open ports <a href='../media/content/documents/open_ports.pdf' target='_blank'>here</a>[PDF, 441.7 KB]. Open ports are big shipping ports, used by fishermen and cargo ships alike, with big concrete piers and bollards. The main ports of entry used by sailors, are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Naha (Okinawa) 26°12’34N 127°40’22E</li>
    <li>Kagoshima (Kyushu) 31°29.665'N 130°30.910'E</li>
    <li>Chichijima (Ogasawara) 27°5.921'N 142°12.013'E</li>
    <li>Osaka (Osaka Bay)</li>
    <li>Yokohama (Honshu)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is possible to enter via a closed port but it requires applying in advance for a <b>Closed Port Permit</b>, see <a href="https://www.mlit.go.jp/en/maritime/specialpermission.html" target="_blank">how to apply</a>. If you want to check in to Naha, Kagoshima and Chichijima, applying for this is necessary. If you fail to obtain permission, they will fine you.</p>
<p>The <b>Open and Closed port</b> system is a remnant of the time when Japan was closed to the world. It used to be that as a sailor, you had to apply for every closed port you were planning on visiting, but since may 2018 it is only necessary to apply for a permit for your first port if it is a closed port.</p>

<h2 id='what_to_send'>what to send</h2>

<ul class='bullet'>
    <li><a href='http://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001244583.docx' target='_blank'>Closed port permission</a>[.Docx, 17.5 KB] (if entering at closed port)</li>

    <li>Passport scans</li>
    <li>Boat papers (certificate of registry)</li>
</ul>

<h3>To the Coastguard</h3>

<p>Once you've chosen your port of entry, you will need to find the email of the coastguard that has jurisdiction over that port.</p>
<ul class='bullet'>
    <li>Naha (Okinawa) jcgbnahakq3-8f5m@mlit.go.jp</li>
    <li>Chichijima (Ogasawara) jcg3ogasawara-9q3p@mlit.go.jp</li>
    <li>Wakayama (Osaka Bay) jcg5wakayamakotsu2-7g2d@mlit.go.jp</li>
    <li>Shimoda, (Shizuoka) jcg3shimodakq1-9t8x@mlit.go.jp</li>
</ul>

<p>Send these documents before leaving your last port. You should also send your preferred contact method, like your <a href='satellite_phone.html' class='local'>satellite phone</a> number, or email. Later, when you are 24 hours away from your destination, send another message to update them on your date and time or arrival. It is okay to send them multiple messages if this information changes.</p>

<p>For more information, view the <a href='https://www.kaiho.mlit.go.jp/ope/apply/hoan00-e.html' target='_blank'>online guide</a> on the Japanese CoastGuard website.</p>

<h3>To the Prefecture Office</h3>

<p>Like the Japanese Coastguard email, you need to find the email of the appointed prefectural representative that will process your closed port permit application. If you are entering in Ogasawara for example, it is part of the Kanto prefecture and so an email must be sent to the Kanto office.</p>

<p> Here is <a href='https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001409476.pdf' target='_blank'>a list</a> of the relevant offices and their emails. To find out how to fill the form, and for more detailed information visit the <a href='http://www.mlit.go.jp/en/maritime/specialpermission.html' target='_blank'>Ministry of Transport online guide</a>.</p>

<p>These documents should be sent before you leave your last port. They will contact you if information is missing.</p>

<h2 id='arrival_in_port'>arrival in port</h2>

<p>At this point, the coastguard should be aware of your arrival and will likely be waiting for you on the pier. <b>It is possible to arrive at night</b>, if this is the case, there will be someone to greet you and to make sure that you don't step on land until you are fully checked in. It's possible that the officials will be there present upon arrival and give you the documents to fill.</p>

<p><b>Customs</b>, <b>quarantine</b> and <b>immigration</b> officials will come to see you. They will likely not speak English, but the forms often have both languages.</p>

<h3>Quarantine</h3>

<p>They will ask if you have any plants, meat or other fresh items on board. They might confiscate them, we had none aboard when they came and so they took nothing. We had many dried legumes and grains aboard, but they did not take them.</p>

<p>You can see a list of prohibited items <a href='https://www.la.us.emb-japan.go.jp/e_web/e_m02_08.htm' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>

<h3>Customs</h3>

<p>The officials will ask for the dates at which you visited your previous ports, and your upcoming destinations, they will ask for precise dates. Because making a long list of planned ports is no longer necessary, you only need to give them a general list.</p>

<p>You must request a <b>内国船舶 Naiko Senpaku</b> or <b>naikosen</b> (domestic boat) registration on arrival. Because we arrived the year they created this permit, many of the officials were not aware of its existence, so insisting was necessary, it is possible that they give it outright to foreign boats, either way, make sure you leave their office with it. This paper changes the boat's domestic status. A naikosen will waive the requirement for you to do port entry/exit customs paperwork in both open and closed ports for as long as you are in Japan. See how to apply for a <a href="https://www.mlit.go.jp/en/maritime/specialpermission.html" target="_blank">naikosen</a>.</p>

<p>You must cancel the Naikosen (returning the boat to “foreign” status) with the customs official of the region before leaving Japan. You can get tax-free fuel this way.</p>

<h3>Immigration</h3>

<p>Officials will ask you to step off the boat, they may take you to an office in town to do the paperwork(this was true for Chichijima). You will have to complete a document, they may take a picture and scan your index fingers. They'll ask you to fill a few more papers, all of which have English writing.</p>

<p>Most travelers are allowed 3 months on a tourist visa, although you may be allowed more depending on your country of origin (U.K, Austria, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, and Mexico nationals can stay 6 months, but must apply for an extension). Your boat can stay in Japan indefinitely.</p>

<h2 id='staying_in_japan_for_a_while'>staying in japan for a while</h2>

<p>As a tourist, you can only stay as long as <b>3 months</b>, which doesn't give you much time to explore Japan by boat. What options are there to stay longer?</p>

<h3>In and Out of the country</h3>

<p>You can only do this once, in any 6 month period so don't count on repeating it after that time. There is a ferry that runs from Fukuoka to Busan that is cheap, and that makes a good option for making a short exit.</p>

<h3>Applying for an extension</h3>

<p>If after 6 months, you can't leave for whatever reason, you can apply for an <b>extension</b>, but extensions are only ever granted in emergencies(boat in need of repairs, bad oceanic weather, etc). For example, we were granted an extension in May 2020 because of the covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>To find out more about the extension process, visit the website of the <a href='https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/status/temporaryvisitor.html?hl=en' target='_blank'>immigration bureau of Japan</a>. The document to extend your stay on a tourist visa are found <a href='https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/status/temporaryvisitor.html?hl=en' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>

<p>The extension costs 4,000 yen, it must be paid with revenue stamps called shunyuinshi (しゅうにゅういんし or 収入印紙) in Japanese. Revenue stamps are available for purchase at the post office or at most convenience stores. It can take 2 weeks to a month to process an extension application.</p>

<h3>Sail to South Korea</h3>

<p>Busan is very close to Japan. If this is your plan, you can sail up the west coast of Japan and exit the country through Tsushima to make the sail to Korea. Canadians can stay in Korea for 6 months, but many other nationalities are granted only 90 days. Extensions are difficult to obtain. If you're planning on staying longer than 90 days, you must obtain a special long-term visa in advance and you will have to apply for a residence certificate at the local immigration office.</p>

<p>Busan isn't ideal to keep your boat for long periods of time, but there are plenty of other places to go. A friend mentioned <a href='https://www.noonsite.com/Countries/SouthKorea/Mokpo' target='_blank'>Mokpo</a> as being a good, cheap place to keep a boat for a long period, but it's a longer sail than Busan.</p>

<h3>Leave the boat in Japan for 6 months</h3>

<p>Your boat is allowed to stay, but you aren't, so one option is to leave your boat in a safe place in Japan for 6 months and to return home. Many cruisers do this (we did this, see <a href='typhoons_and_mold.html'>our post</a> about it), leaving the boat in the fall and returning to Japan in the spring.</p>

<h2 id='sailing_at_night'>sailing at night</h2>

<p>Sailing in Japan is different from other places in the world, in the way that sailing at night is strongly discouraged, due to the presence of nets, floats, algae, and fish farms. When sailing through the inland sea, a watch at the bow is necessary, even in daytime, so this gives you an idea of what it may be like at night. A lot of fishermen don't have AIS, and are not always on watch at night either, so it's best to keep transit times short and during the daylight hours. If a longer passage is necessary, sailing offshore may help to avoid dangers. There is also offshore traffic to consider, especially near and around the Kii peninsula.</p>

<p>If you plan to sail extensively through Japan, chances are you'll be mooring in many small fishing harbours onto concrete piers. The walls may, or may not have big rubber bits, and some will have gaps that make it difficult to protect your boat using only fenders. In all cases, having a fenderboard is useful, it will keep your fenders from going into the gaps of the dock and will protect them from the rough concrete pier. The big rubber bits that many ports have can help to protect your boat, but will leave marks.</p>

<h2 id='contacting_authorities'>contacting authorities</h2>

<p>Not many yachties use VHF in Japan, you may not get an answer if you try to contact others with it. Channel 16 is reserved for emergencies, like in the rest of the world.</p>

<ul class='bullet'>
    <li>Police – Dial 110 (Toll-free)</li>
    <li>Fire – Dial 119 (Toll-free)</li>
    <li>Ambulance – Dial 119 (Toll-free)</li>
    <li>Marine Emergency – Dial 118 (Toll-free)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='trash_and_recycling'>trash and recycling</h2>

<img src='../media/content/travel/japan_recycling.png' loading='lazy' />

<p>Understanding trash & recycling is a big part of daily life in Japan. Being an island, and a place where lots of packaging is being used, they put extra care in the proper recycling and burning of consumables, landfills are not an option. All refuse and recyclable products are washed, and separated. </p>

<p>As a visitor, you should try to inform yourself as much as you can, try to find a guide that will help you divide everything up properly. Many convenience stores will have bins outside of their store for recyclables, although generally they prefer it to be used for their own products, but if you don't have any other options it's better to leave your pet bottles, cans and plastics here. They'll usually have a bin for burnable trash too, usually labelled as 燃えるゴミ, the Japanese word for garbage is <i>gomi</i>. Only deposit small bags in 燃えるゴミ bins, don't pile bags outside of the bins.</p>

<p>Another way to get rid of garbage, is to get the city's schedule for the disposal of items and to leave them on the street along with the recyclables and/or trash of your neighbours. If you can't find a schedule, just take a peek at what is out on the curb and that should make it clear what you can and can't bring out on that particular day. Although, make sure to take it out on the right day, because every item has its own pickup time and day. If you want to put your trash and recyclables with that of others, do it right, because otherwise the truck will not pick it up and label it with a sticker. By doing it wrong, you'll make it someone else's problem and that isn't nice.</p>

<p>Another obvious option is to pay for moorage at a marina or to visit a sailing club, they'll allow for recycling and trash disposal. While in Shimizu, we went to a marina dock to dispose of our very dead PVC dinghy <a href='iggy.html' class='local'>Iggy</a>, you may want to ask permission when disposing of large items. While in Minamiise in Mie, the boatyard could take metal for recycling.</p>

<h2 id='restaurants'>restaurants</h2>

<p>Many restaurants have menus with pictures that you can use if you're not very good with kanji, katakana or hiragana (3 Japanese alphabets). It may be worth learning katakana at least, since it is often used for English terms which are sounded out in Japanese. For example:</p>

<ul class='bullet'>
    <li>ビール (Biiru) is 'Beer'</li>
    <li>スパゲティ (Supagetti) is 'Spaghetti'.</li>
</ul>

<p>Restaurants where there are many tourists, will often have an English menu. They will likely offer it to you on arrival if they've got one, otherwise you can ask for it with:</p>

<ul class='bullet'>
    <li>英語のメニュはありますか</li>
    <li>Eigo no menyuu wa arimasu ka</li>
    <li>Do you have an English menu?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Eigo</b> is the word for English, and <b>menyuu</b> for menu. If they don't have an English menu, you can always ask them for a recommendation by saying</p>

<ul class='bullet'>
    <li>おすすめおねがいします</li>
    <li>Osusume onegaishimasu</li>
    <li>Your recommendations please!</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don't know what to pick on a menu and aren't picky about the food, the word <b>osusume</b> is a magic word, it can help in a bind and you can discover something new by using it! Osusume means "recommendation". If you use this word, you leave it to them to pick something for you, they'll likely serve you a popular item, or a house special. Know that there is no tipping in Japan in restaurants.</p>

<h3>Food restrictions</h3>

<p>If you have food restrictions, like if you don't eat meat, fish or dairy, refer to our detailed <a href='plantbased_diet_in_japan.html'>plantbased diet in Japan guide</a>.</p>

<p>If you have allergies, the word is: アレルギ(aregugii). View <a href='https://livejapan.com/en/article-a0001856/' target='_blank'>Live Japan Guide</a> for more information on allergies and reading labels in Japan.</p>

<p>If you've got serious allergies, it is best to print an <a href='https://www.foodallergy.org/resources/food-allergy-chef-cards' target='_blank'>international allergy card</a> to show restaurants or shop owners.</p>

<h2 id='agents'>agents</h2>

<p>Agents aren't necessary when cruising in Japan, but if you want one anyway, contact Kirk Patterson through his agency <a href='https://www.konpira-consulting.com/services/japan-cruising-support.html' target='_blank'>Konpira consulting</a>. He has sailed extensively throughout Japan, and will be able to help you.</p>

<p>Kirk is so famous now that when we visited in 2019, a random Japanese sailor gave us his phone one time with Kirk on the line, completely unprompted. We think the reason the sailor did this was because he thought we would benefit from his expertise (we didn't in the end, but it was nice to talk to him, we had exchanged emails in the past about visa extensions).</p>

<h2 id='electricity'>electricity</h2>

<p>Voltage in Japan is 100V, American and Canadian boats will have no problem in marinas here, we could use our boat cord but had to go through a converter. If you buy electronics here and plan to use them back home, it is necessary to buy a step up/down transformer or you will burn out the unit. We mostly relied on solar to charge our batteries, we only used the AC connection to power a small
