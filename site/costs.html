<h2 id='maintenance'>maintenance</h2>
<p>Doing maintenance and repairs yourself will bring the cost down. Offloading work to professionals, if you can afford it, is fine, but it's good to know how to take care of your boat because you may not always have access to workers if sailing to far-flung islands. Modern-built boats require less maintenance work than say, wooden boats. A failure to maintain items regularly will cost more later.</p>

<p>Maintenance checklist:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Engine(s)</li>
    <li>The boatâ€™s hull (bottom) & topsides, electrical systems</li>
    <li>Electrical systems</li>
    <li>Plumbing</li>
    <li>Moving parts (hinges, tracks and zippers)</li>
    <li>Canvas and upholstery</li>
</ul>

<p>When doing repairs, use quality materials and products, research them thoroughly before a project instead of relying on brand names.</p>

<p>Some years will cost more than others, as gear wears out, if hardware or lines need replacing.</p>

<p>Tasks like hauling-out (to get the bottom painted) doesn't happen every year (once every 2-3 years for an offshore boat). We use ablative anti-fouling which costs about $250 to paint a 10 m yacht. If you coat your prop with prop speed (to slow growth on it) you'll pay an additional $200. Yard fees vary from place to place, those closer to large cities will cost more. In New Zealand, it cost us $420 total, including bottom rinse, haul in and out and days to stay on the hard. While in Japan, it was about double that price for half the time spent on the hard. </p>

<p>A head that is used everyday will suffer accumulations of calcium, cleaning out the pipes with vinegar/baking soda is a must. A failure to do this, means clogged pipes and having to clean them out manually, we have done this, and it was horrible. The joker valve in heads are a common breaking point, as are macerators and other devices or piping in contact with salt  water.</p>

<p>Traveling offshore means more wear because the boat is under more stress. Repair and maintenance can cost between $500-800 per year for a 10 m yacht like ours. This price goes up and down depending on where we go, and what has to be replaced that year. In 2018 while in New Zealand, we spent around <a href='projects_and_pain.html'>$10k on Pino</a> to get it ready for Japan and the subsequent trip to Canada. This was the most we'd spent in a year, and was due to the purchase of a new AIS system, mainsail, throttle cables, replacement windows, top hatch, galley plumbing, replacement batteries and solar panels. Our first year was also expensive, because the boat was not outfitted for sailing offshore, we had to buy lifejackets, jacklines, a drogue, extra lines, shackles, a med-kit, extra tools, a location device, a handheld VHF, a SAT phone, foul-weather gear, engine spares etc..</p>

<p>Engines require spare parts, like oil ($25) and fuel filters ($10), they should be replaced 250 hours (300 hours on some models) or once per year, whichever is sooner. Our engine has two fuel filters, a secondary and primary. Other items that need to be replaced periodically include: water pump impellers ($40), water pump and alternator belt (15-$20), zincs (inside engine, $8 each), shaft zinc ($16 each) etc.</p>

<h2 id='moorage'>moorage</h2><p>Living at anchor, that is, in a bay somewhere tethered to the earth with <a href='ground_tackle.html'>ground_tackle</a> is free. Some bays will have moorings installed that you can tie to for a small fee (often around $10-15.). Living at anchor is the cheap way to go, although getting a good anchor and rode is important as it will keep your boat safe.</p>

<p>Some bays will have moorings installed that you can tie to for a small fee (often around 10-15$.)</p>

<p>Marinas often have guest docks with power, WiFi and showers, for a medium-to-high cost ($300-$800.) The longer the boat though, the bigger the cost. Some marinas charge per dock space rather than boat size, beware of these places. Moorage near cities is more expensive, and the price goes up during the high season (summer). Winter moorage is generally much cheaper.</p>

<p>Paying for annual moorage is a good idea, but keeping a boat in a marina means getting liability insurance, which in turn, means you'll need a survey, resulting in a seemingly interminable domino effect which can incur many more costs. Depending on the age of your boat, and when it was last surveyed (if ever), you may need a full condition out-of-water survey. This means paying a marina to lift your boat out, and paying the surveyor. A surveyor will point out mandatory items that need fixing and/or replacing, if these items are not complied with within 60 days the insurance will be void.</p>

<p>Living aboard your boat will cause wear from regular use of the space. If staying at a marina in your home country for long periods, paying for <b>liveaboard fees</b> (up to $150 extra per month) is necessary. If staying in a marina in a foreign country, liveaboard fees are often waived. Some marinas charge for electricity and water, be sure to take that into account, especially if you have plans to winter there and that your heating is electric. In winter, marinas charge less than in the high season. For example, the city docks in Victoria costs us 570$ a month in winter, and summer rates are about $880S.</p>
<h2 id='offshore'>offshore</h2><p>If you want to go offshore, there is a long list of safety items, tools and spares that you need to have.</p>

<p>Consult a <a href='https://www.vicmaui.org/official-notice-board' target='_blank' class='external'>vessel and equipment checks list</a> (Safety Consultation Checklist). Another helpful reference document for gearing up for offshore travel, is the <a href='https://astrolabesailing.com/2014/03/24/yachting-nz-cat-1/' target='_blank' class='external'>New Zealand Cat 1 requirements list</a>. New Zealand registered yachts can't go offshore without passing a Cat 1 survey, if they don't pass, they can't leave.</p>

<p>Before every long passage, we do a thorough check of all equipment on board, this means looking at the stitching on the sails, testing the electronics, checking the running and standing rigging etc. For the first time, have someone with you to help, you can also hire professionals to inspect your boat. For example, we hired a rigger to inspect Pino's standing rigging when we were planning to go offshore for the first time. We asked him a lot of questions, watched how he did things etc.</p>
<p>In short, here's what you ought to do, or ought to have to sail offshore:</p>

<p><b>Med-kit</b>. The contents and storage of the First Aid Kit shall reflect the likely conditions and duration of the passage, and the number of crew.</p>

<p><b>Cockpit knife</b>. A strong, sharp knife, sheathed and securely restrained shall be provided readily accessible from the deck or a cockpit.</p>

<p><b>Radar reflector</b>. Be seen by larger ships, get one. Even better, is an AIS transponder, but not essential.</p>

<p><b>lifejackets</b>. Make sure it comes with a sailing harness, and ideally crotch strap. Carry extra refills if auto-inflating, as it isn't standardized (can't get specific models shipped by air, so carry enough).</p>

<p><b>Bolt/tie everything down</b>. Modern boats don't always have bolted floors, or latches. If note, add some. Add a strap to tie down your engine, in case it comes loose so it doesn't come crashing through the cabin.</p>

<p><b>Tethers</b>. So you can tether yourself when outside in the cockpit, or if doing work on deck. Get short tethers, rather than long ones. Also, if you can, get a tether with 3 clips, so if you unclip to clip elsewhere, you're always tied to one spot.</p>

<p><b>Jacklines</b>. Set up jacklines that run along the deck, that you can clip your tether onto to do work on deck. Make sure jacklines are tight.</p>

<p><b>Storm sail</b>. Get a trysail, and/or storm jib. Or add a third reef to your main. A storm jib is useful even if you don't encounter storm conditions, as it's possible to use to self-steer using the poled-out storm jib method. If your windvane, or autopilot fails, this is a great, tested technique to self-steer a boat in any condition.</p>

<p><b>Bungees, surgical tube or bike tube</b>. Good for self-steering, again, in case your windpilot fails.</p>

<p><b>Flashlights</b>. Plenty of waterproof flashlights, distribute them around the cabin. Get a light that is rechargable by hand, for emergencies.</p>

<p><b>Bolt cutters</b>. The largest pair you can carry.</p>

<p><b>Handheld VHF</b>. Useful as backup should your main radio fail, also useful to throw in a ditch bag, or to find out your position if having chart plotter issues.</p>

<p><b>Sextant</b>. Electronics are prone to failure, and knowing where you are in the world is important. A sextant can save your life.</p>

<p><b>Emergency manual pump</b>. Or another manual bilge pump, workable from inside the cabin.</p>

<h3>Costs</h3>

<p>Traveling offshore costs more because the boat is under more stress. Repair and maintenance can cost between 500-800$ per year for a 10 m yacht like ours. This price goes up and down depending on where we go, and what has to be replaced that year. In 2018 while in New Zealand, we spent around <a href='projects_and_pain.html'>10,000$ on Pino</a> to get it ready for Japan and the subsequent trip to Canada. This was the most we'd spent in a year, and was due to the purchase of a new AIS system, mainsail, throttle cables, replacement windows, top hatch, galley plumbing, replacement batteries and solar panels.</p>

<h2 id='safety_gear'>safety_gear</h2><p>Safety gear will last you many years if serviced regularly. <b>Pyrotechnic signaling devices</b> (including aerial flares and hand held signals) expire 42 months after the date of manufacture in accordance with the Coast Guard requirements. Typically, this means that you must replace your flares every three boating seasons. Aerial flares cost $75 per pack of 6 (in Canada), for a boat our size (10 m) we need to have 12 aboard.</p>
<p><b>Life jackets</b> and <b>life rafts</b> need to be serviced every 3 years, as the auto-inflating canisters need testing, and replacing. Replacement cartridges for auto-inflating PFD's cost about $35 (again, in Canada). If planning to travel for many years out of the country, carry replacement cartridges onboard, because other countries may not carry the ones required by your model and that replacements can't be shipped by air (they're pressurized). Re-packing a liferaft is very expensive, and varies depending on the model, and your location in the world.</p>
