<h1>gimballed stove</h1><p><b>2024.02.06<br>Victoria, BC</b>.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/gimballed_stove_07.jpg' loading='lazy' />

<p>Single LPG burners are not common, but a local marine store found us a European model with a converter(+15$) for the LPG connection(North American standards differ a little bit). The unit was 400$ new, but we got it for 250$CAD because of a defect. The LPG components are fine, the defect is cosmetic(the top SS plate has a slight bend to it). </p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/gimballed_stove_04.jpg' loading='lazy' />

<p>This burner is made by Eno, a company that has swallowed up the once Canadian-owned Force10(the makers of our former LPG stove).</p>

<p>Our plan for the gimballed stove was to make a SS-covered surface for the burner, and to attach another layer underneath to store a heavy Lodge cast-iron square griddle we have which would also serve as ballast for the gimbal(we don't use it at sea). </p>

<h3>The burner layer</h3>

<p>Sailor Sarah R. graciously gave us a sheet of SS she didn't need, which we cut to cover a length of wood that would nest our new gimballed burner. The wood was cut when we built our <a href='open_pantry.html' class='local'>open pantry</a>. We would have liked to make an all-stainless steel layer, but thin sheets of SS aren't strong enough to support anything, not unless the sheet has good bends and we can't do that ourselves. Local fabricators don't have time to take on small projects like this, and we don't have access to tools that would permit us to bend the sheet correctly.</p>

<p>We borrowed Peter's grinder because we somehow lost the locknut for ours(a replacement is on the way). Using it, we cut a hole in the SS sheet matching the size of our burner, and did the same for the wood piece that will sit underneath it (using another tool).</p>

<p>We knew we couldn't do precise bends, but we could still work the SS sheet around the front and back of the wood, overlapping part of the bottom. Even if the SS is thin, bending it by hand to meet the edge of the wood requires patience. We secured the SS sheet over the wood with several adjustable clamps, then laid the side on the ground(with a mat underneath) and used the weight of our bodies to make a bend. To bend it further so that it meets the side better, we placed a block of wood over the side(over the wood and SS) and banged on it with a rubber mallet.</p>

<p>Apparently, it is possible to work it into a bend using just a piece of wood but we couldn't manage it, it depends on the thickness of the SS. Even the rubber mallet wasn't enough to refine the edge, we also used a small drill press vise, setting the mouth of the vise over the edge(someone had to hold the bottom edge of the sheet down so that it could fit in the gap) and tightening the jaws as hard as we could. The jaws force the two sides down, forcing a bend. Because the vise is not wide, we loosened it, moved it a bit further, tightened it again, then repeated this process for the whole length.</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/gimballed_stove_11.jpg' loading='lazy' />

<p>The result was a decent bend (two bends per edge), perfect for our purpose. We drilled holes in the back and put in 4 screws per side to hold the metal onto the wood (the SS sheet bends over the edges and overlaps part of the bottom).</p>

<p>This is what the burner looks like when set into the hole. The burner is secured by way of 3 brackets(they come with the burner when you buy it).</p>

<img src='../media/content/boat_projects/gimballed_stove_12.jpg' loading='lazy' />

<p>We re-used two aluminum rails from a former project to decorate the edges, isolating the two metals with some non-conductive material(see <a href='effect_of_combining_dissimilar_metals.html' class='local'>effect of combining dissimilar metals</a>). Electrical insulating sleeve washers(plastic washers with a collar) are also a good idea for the SS screws.</p>

<h3>The lower layer, and gimbal</h3>

<p>To make the gimbal, we used two thick SS brackets we had left-over from another project-we say that a lot, we've got a of miscellaneous bits aboard. The design of these brackets was ideal, we wouldn't have to drill holes into thick SS, yay! Drilling into thick stainless steel is hard work, if you're not patient and try to hasten the process the material will only get harder(a phenomenon known as work harderning), it will punish you and dull all of your expensive cobalt drill bits.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we only had to drill through thin SS this tim</p>

<p>We couldn't re-use the holes left by the former stove, so we drilled new holes where the new burner would 'hang'. Force10 stoves have a built-in rounded peg on each side, which slide into a wall bracket. The pegs rest into a hole, and the oven is held down by its own weight. This design is flawed, because if the boat is rolled there is a chance that the heavy oven can leap out of its spot. For our little burner, we used 2 heavy hex bolts to create the fixed rotation point for the gimbal(like the pegs for the Force10 oven). The hex bolts will go through both brackets, so the burner can't leap out of its bindings.</p>

<p>We used 4 long hex bolts to secure the top and lower layer of our gimballed platform. The hex bolts go through the first layer, through short lengths of SS tubing (off-cuts from another project), through the lower layer and are terminated by nuts. The SS tubing keeps the two layers separate. This design permits plenty of air to flow below and around the burner, which is essential for an LPG appliance, the area below a drop-in burner like ours should not be closed in.</p>
