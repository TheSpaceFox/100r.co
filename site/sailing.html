        <p>If you can do the same speed with less sail, do it. As soon as you think of reefing down, do it. Should we reduce sails? Yes, always yes.</p>
        <p>Shaking out a reef is easier than putting one in in high winds.</p>
        <h2 id='navigation'>navigation</h2>
        <p>The entire task of navigation rests upon the <b>Navionics</b> app, installed onto all of our mobile devices. Its depth maps, compass, GPS, waypoints, community edits, and more, are all the features that we could ever wish for to get from A to B, over water. We use it along with a separate AIS app for traffic.</p>
        <h2 id='no_schedules'>no schedules</h2>
        <p>Sailing with a schedule is a recipe for disaster, too many things can happen on a boat and arriving on a precise date can be difficult. Making plans will make you do bad decisions, leaving in bad weather to make a meeting for instance, can be dangerous. Sail with the weather, not against it.</p>
        <h2 id='ground_tackle'>ground tackle</h2><img src='../media/content/knowledge/rocna.jpg'>
        <p>We carry 3 anchors onboard. We have a Bruce 10 kg, and a Rocna 10 kg and 15 kg. Some will argue that bigger is better, but in our experience the quality and shape of the anchor, as well as your scope makes all the difference. If you want to upsize, your bow roller may need replacing, and in the event of windlass breakage, heaving it up by hand could be next to impossible. We have extra lengths of chain and rope.</p>
        <p>We carry 30.5m of chain on <a href='pino.html' target='_self' class='local'>Pino</a>, with 61m of 3-strand nylon. This means that we anchor safely in waters no deeper than 11m, we have found plenty of anchorages in the South Pacific in that depth range.</p>
        <h2 id='weatherforecast'>weather forecasts</h2>
        <p>Our favourite weather service is <a href='http://windy.com' target='_blank'>Windy</a>, and while underway, we download weather maps(.grb files) through the <a href='http://saildocs.com' target='_blank'>saildocs</a> service with our Satellite Phone which we then process with <a href='http://predictwind.com' target='_blank'>PredictWind</a>. We pick our weather carefully on passage, no sense in taking unnecessary risks.</p>
        <p>For information on storms brewing in the Pacific and Atlantic, as well as passage advice in the South Pacific, we enjoy reading <a href='https://metbob.wordpress.com/' target='_blank'>MetBob</a>.</p>
        <h2 id='radio'>radio</h2>
        <p>As a sailor, you <b>must offer help</b> to a boat in trouble. Radio communication is key, specific channels are used in every country for emergencies or information exchange. Every morning, sailors will tune in to a specific channel and listen to a <b>morning net</b>, a public radio exchange in which the weather and local events are announced, as well as boats seeking crew, or items that need to be sold or found. When the weather is foul, the local channels are very busy.</p>
        <h2 id='camaraderie'>camaraderie</h2><img src='../media/content/knowledge/comraderie.jpg'>
        <p>There is an unspoken understanding between sailors, an exchange of looks when foul weather is amidst. Every member of the sailing community knows the difficulties of life at sea, and is ready to lend a hand. We refer to each other by boat name, and like bird-watchers, we can identify rare breeds by sight. When transiting through world routes, we meet the same boats often, thus strenghtening the connection.</p>
        <h2 id='night_time'>night time</h2>
        <p>During long passages, we must sail throughout the nights. Our pattern, for two crew, is one sleeps between 1900 and 2100, then sails between 2100 and 2400, then goes back to sleep from 2400 until 300, and then goes back to the wheel between 300 and 600.</p>
        <p>During these long nights, we listen to countless podcasts and audiobooks, which we discuss around breakfast in the morning. If we're feeling especially tired, listening to upbeat music, as opposed to spoken content helps.</p>
        <p>During long passages, our daytime sailing occupations include: cooking, cleaning, doing fixes on the boat and brainstorming on future projects. We don't have a tight schedule for day watches, we hand the wheel to the other as we get tired.</p>
        <h2 id='eliminating_electricity'>eliminating electricity</h2>
        <p>Our aim is to have as few items as possible on board that demand power. More power means more batteries, solar panels, wiring and devices that are sensitive to salt.</p>
        <h2 id='seasickness'>seasickness</h2>
        <p>Here's a few of our tricks against seasickness.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't drink alcohol or coffee the day before leaving.</li>
            <li>Eat before you're hungry.</li>
            <li>Rest before you're tired.</li>
            <li>Don't let yourself get cold.</li>
            <li>If everything else fails, take the helm.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id='offshore_sailing'>offshore sailing</h2>
        <p>Here's a few quick tips for offshore sailing.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anything on deck is sacrificial.</li>
            <li>In heavy winds, heave-to, don't run.</li>
            <li>When tired, heave-to, don't push too hard.</li>
            <li>Learn how to self-steer without external devices.</li>
            <li>Buy a good set of oil skins.</li>
            <li>In the cold, wear wool, not synthetics.</li>
            <li>Store main anchor below decks.</li>
            <li>Secure all floorboards and doors.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id='boat_repair'>Boat repair</h2>
        <p>Here's a few quick tips for boat repair and upkeep.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stop leaky chainplates with butyl tape.</li>
            <li>Coat structural plywood with fibreglass and resin to prevent rot.</li>
            <li>More to come soon...</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id='knots'>Knots</h2>
        <p>Knots to learn to tie behind your back:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The square knot</li>
            <li>The sheet bend</li>
            <li>The round turn</li>
            <li>The half hitch</li>
            <li>The rolling hitch</li>
            <li>The bowline</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id='costs'>costs</h2>
        <p><b>Moorage. </b>Living at anchor, that is, in a bay somewhere tethered to the earth with ground tackle is free. Some bays will have moorings installed that can be used for a small fee (often around 10-15$.) Marinas often have guest docks with power, wifi and showers, for a medium-to-high cost (300$-800$.) The longer the boat though, the bigger the cost. Some marinas though, charge per dock space rather than boat size, beware of these places. Moorage near cities is more expensive, and the price goes up during the high season (summer). Winter moorage is generally much cheaper. Paying for annual moorage is a good idea, but keeping a boat in a marina means getting liability insurance, which in turn, means you'll need a survey, resulting in a seemingly interminable domino effect which can incur many more costs. Depending the age of your boat, and when it was last surveyed (if ever), you may need a full condition out-of-water survey. This means paying a marina to lift your boat out, and paying the surveyor. A surveyor will point out mandatory items that need fixing and/or replacing, if these items are not complied with within 60 days the insurance will be void. Living at anchor is the cheap way to go, although getting good ground tackle (rode and anchor) is important as it will keep your boat safe.</p>
        <p><b>Maintenance.</b> Maintaining a boat is not cheap, especially if you decide to go offshore because the ocean is rough and wears a boat down fast. Doing maintenance and repairs yourself will bring the cost down. Offloading work to professionals, if you can afford it, is fine, but it's good to know how to take care of your boat because you may not always have access to workers if sailing to far-flung islands. Modern-built boats require less maintenance work than say, wooden boats. A failure to maintain items reguarly will cost more later.</p>
        <h3>Maintenance checklist:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Engine(s)</li>
            <li>The boat’s hull (bottom) & topsides, electrical systems</li>
            <li>Electrical systems</li>
            <li>Plumbing</li>
            <li>Moving parts (hinges, tracks and zippers)</li>
            <li>Canvas and upholstery</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tasks like hauling-out (to get the bottom painted) doesn't happen every year (once every 2-3 years for an offshore boat). Some years will cost more than others, as gear wears out, if new sails (1000$-3000$) or lines need replacing. When doing repairs, use quality materials and products, research them thoroughly before a project instead of relying on brand names.</p>
        <p><b>Safety.</b> Safety gear will last you many years if serviced regularly. Pyrotechnic signaling devices (including aerial flares and hand held signals) expire 42 months after the date of manufacture in accordance with the Coast Guard requirements. Typically, this means that you must replace your flares every three boating seasons. Aerial flares cost 75$ per pack of 6 (in Canada), for a boat our size (10m) we need to have 12 aboard. Life jackets and life rafts need to be serviced every 3 years, as the auto-inflating cannisters need testing, and replacing. Replacement cartridges for auto-inflating PFD's cost about 35$ (again, in Canada). If planning to travel for many years out of the country, carry replacement cartridges onboard, because other countries may not carry the ones required by your model and that replacements can't be shipped by air (they're pressurized). Re-packing a liferaft is very expensive, and varies depending on the model, and your location in the world.</p>

        <p>When reading the weather on a passage, don't rely solely on weather reports. Learn to read the weather with books, and by observing, and studying the sky.

        <p class='quote'> “When clouds appear like rocks and towers, the Earth’s refreshed with frequent showers.”</quote>
   
        <p><b>Anvil top cloud</b>: Named for their likeness to an iron anvil, anvil clouds are the icy upper portions of cumulonimbus thunderstorm clouds that are caused by a rising of air in the lower portions of the atmosphere. When the rising air reaches 40,000-60,000 or more feet, it tends to spread out in a characteristic anvil shape. Generally, the taller the cumulonimbus cloud, the more severe the storm will be.</p>

        <p>The anvil top of a cumulonimbus cloud is actually caused by it hitting the top of the stratosphere—the second layer of the atmosphere. Since this layer acts as a "cap" to convection (the cooler temperatures at its top discourage thunderstorms (convection), the tops of storm clouds have nowhere to go but spread outward.</p>

        <p>At sea, keep your eyes on the clouds. If you notice a cumulonimbus cloud with an anvil top cloud forming, and that it is pointing toward you, reef your sails, as the weather could get very nasty. If the wind is trong, the anvil will sheer off in the direction the wind is blowing.</p>

        <p class='quote'>"A ring around the sun or moon, means that rain will come real soon.”</p>

        <p><b>A ring around the moon</b>: A halo forming around the sun, or moon, is caused by the refraction of sunlight, or moonlight, by ice crystals in high altitudes. Moisture forming at such heights is indicative that is moving downwards, and that an active weather system is coming.</p>

        <p class='quote'>“Mackerel skies and mares’ tails, make tall ships carry low sails.”</p>

        <p><b>Cirrocumulus clouds</b>: Cirrocumulus clouds, or 'mare's tales' and 'mackerel scales', indicate an approaching warm front, with veering winds (clocking around from NE and E over to SW and W) with rain.</p>

        <p><b>Red sky at night</b>: In the northern hemisphere, as the sun sets, light shines through the lower atmosphere which is full of dust, salt, smoke and pollution. The particles scatter the shorter wavelengths of light at the blue end of the spectrum, leaving only the longer wavelengths (at the red end of the spectrum) to shine through. In a high-pressure area, air sinks and holds air contaminants near the earth, making the sunset even more red.</p>

        <p><b>Red sky in the morning</b>: A red sky in the eastern morning sky, occurs for the same reasons as a red sky at night, but then the high pressure region has already passed from West to East, and may indicate an area of low pressure is coming.  Low pressure systems bring clouds, rain and storms.</p>

        <p>Other indicators of deteriorating weather:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduction in visibility</li>
            <li>Direction of wind, shifting from N > E, or from E > S (cold front).</li>
            <li>Clouds moving in different direction, at different heights indicate shifting winds and approaching storm fronts.</li>
            <li>Cumulus begin to develop vertically and darken</li>
            <li>Sky is dark and threatening to the West.</li>
            <li>Clouds increasing in numbers, moving rapidly across the sky.</li>

        <p class='quote'> “When the glass falls low, prepare for a blow; when the glass is high, let your kites fly.”</quote>

        <p>A good barometer is a lifesaver on a boat. At sea, record the barometer readings every hour. If you see any sudden changes, this is telling of a change in weather. The larger the barometric change, the more extreme the weather change. 

        <p><b>Aneroid barometers</b>: Inside an aneroid barometer (aneroid = without fluid) is a small capsule. This capsule has had the air pumped out of it. When the air pressure rises, the sides of the capsule are compressed. The capsule is attached to levers which move a needle as the air pressure squeezes the capsule. A dial behind the needle tells you the air pressure and altitude or weather forecast. They are less accurate than mercurial barometers.</p>

        <p>Wonder if your barometer is working? You can find out using a plastic bag. The idea is that if you seal it in with a pocket of air, and press on the bag, if the unit isn't faulty, the needle will move clock-wise as the pressure within the bag changes.</p>

        <p>The Beaufort Scale of Wind Force was developed in 1805 by Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort as a means for sailors to gauge wind speeds through visual observations of the sea state.</p>
