<h1>tonga</h1><img src='../media/content/tonga/01.jpg' loading='lazy'>

<p>In mid August 2017, we sailed to Tonga from <a href='niue.html' class='local'>niue</a>, and stayed for 2 1/2 months.</p>

<p>We anchored right outside of Neiafu before checking in because of weather, and because it was a weekend and that they likely could not process us. We knew we had to moor into a concrete pier to check in, and that if the wind was blowing from the south that it would be hard to get on, and off of it. We put up our quarantine flag, and waited till morning to go. The wind had calmed then, we found a spot and upon stepping foot ashore, were instantly accosted by a Tongan man, asking us for spare ropes. Pino was not secured to the dock yet, and this man kept asking us questions anyway, seemingly unaware of this fact. We asked him to come back later. We regretted being so abrupt with him, but docking with some wind, onto a messy, concrete pier required all of our attention.</p>

<p>The officials came in turns, but were disappointed when we could not offer refreshment other then water (our stores were low). We many many papers to fill, forms that resembled those for checking into Australia or New Zealand. They did not inspect the boat, but were happy to walk away with money and a signed form saying we were 'clean' of contaminants. Then, we found a mooring buoy in town and explored the area. We met Alofi, a friendly local who rows around the harbor every morning. Like the man on the dock, he too asked services and goods from people on boats. He liked asking for coffee. We spoke to him a few times, and came to recognize the sound of his voice as he made his daily rounds.</p>

<p>It is possible to anchor in Neiafu, but most of the bay is very deep, and shallow areas are occupied by moorings, and are very far from town. We anchored in that area once, to try it. Our chain snagged on a few rocks down there, but we did not have trouble pulling it back up again. Anchoring there was interesting, we could hear fruit bats at night screaming in the trees.</p>

<p>Neiafu had a small area lined with shops, where we could buy staples like flour and rice. We visited town fresh food market often. It was outside, with many people coming everyday to sell their produce. There were baskets of taro root, melon, carrots, herbs etc. The town changed a lot when cruiseships came around. There would be more stands everywhere, offering services and souvenirs, and the locals would put on a show, dressing in traditional wear. The ships never stayed long, and when they'd leave the townspeople would dress in plain clothes again.</p>

<p>Tonga is a very traditional, and very Christian. Tongans are churchgoers, ever since Methodist missionaries arrived in 1822. Everyone goes to church on Sundays. All of the school kids wear uniforms, in the colours of their respective churches (light blue for Catholic, royal blue for Wesleyan...) and Red for Government Schools. They wear a Ta'ovala—a woven mat wrapped around the waist—bordered (with school colours) and a tupenu (wrapped garment, worn by boys) with a white button-up shirt.</p>

<p>Foreign-owned restaurants and cafes here like to provide services for tourists, and cruisers. One restaurant serves coffee, and offers the use of computers. Also, they have a binder full of film titles, which you can 'buy' for a small fee. They might also charge you nothing, if you can give them films they do not already have. We thought this blackmarket of digital film trading was funny. No one cares here. Another restaurant helps boaters recycle and dispose of trash, for a fee. They also offer water. Although, an Oyster boat rally passed through town once, and they left a pile of trash on their doorstep without paying. The owner was very angry, and we were disappointed. These people own million dollar boats, and don't bother to pay locals to dispose of their plastic chairs and garbage. When we left, they had just purchased a glass crusher, to further process some of the waste.</p>

<p>We spent most of our time tucked into Port Maurelle, a bay sheltered from most directions that was perfect for swimming. We saw many wonderful sea creatures here, like octopus, sea turtles, cuttlefish, needle fish, rainbow fish etc. Devine liked to swim in the deeps, and was able to dive down to 9 m (30 ft) with a snorkle and mask, without fins. We dropped a towel once, it settled in the sand underneath Pino and Devine was able to retrieve it. Rekka is a long-distance surface swimmer, and would circle the entire bay almost every day. We liked to play catch on the beach, and enjoyed cartwheeling in the shallows.</p>

<p>There are many caves to explore in the area, including one that you have to dive underwater to get to. We had to time our dive with waves so as to be able to swim inside more easily. Other caves were accessible by dinghy.</p>

<p>Port Maurelle had no services, if we wanted to get food we had to sail to Neiafu..</p>

<p>We liked to buy raw shelled peanuts to roast ourselves, and breadfruit.</p>

<p>While there, we worked on <a href='markl.html' class='local'>markl</a>. Pino's next stop after Tonga was <a href='new_zealand.html' class='local'>new zealand</a>.</p>
