<h1>princess louisa inlet</h1><p><b>Tenedos Bay<br>23.06.20</b></p>

<p>On June 19th, we left <a href='smuggler_cove.html' class='local'>smuggler cove</a> and went to the public dock in Pender Harbour to re-supply, we have plenty to eat on board but we lacked fresh ingredients, with plans to head into Jervis Inlet the next day.</p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/pl_24.jpg' loading='lazy'>

<p>We left Pender Harbour at 11h30, and headed into Agmamenon Channel. Our plan was to anchor in Green Bay, and to maybe wander into Hotham Sound the day after, but we found such good wind in the channel that we decided to keep sailing. Pino was running downwind, wing on wing, gliding effortlessly through the channel.</p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/pl_22.jpg' loading='lazy'>

<p>We'd read that this was a busy commercial artery, but we found it quiet and devoid of traffic. We had wind right up to where it opens up into Jervis Inlet proper, with Skoookumchuck Narrows to our starboard side, and Hotham sound on the other. The wind was disturbed by all of the various arms of this area, and died right off. It picked up again near Dark Cove, and then we decided to try our luck, and to head north, into Prince of Wales Reach.</p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/pl_21.jpg' loading='lazy'>

<p>When heading north toward Princess Louisa Inlet, there are three reaches to go through: Prince of Wales Reach, Princess Royal Reach, and Queen's Reach. All have their particularities.</p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/pl_20.jpg' loading='lazy'>

<p>Prince of Wales Reach offered good wind, but we rolled up the jib and ran on main alone because of the occasional williwaws that came rolling down from the mountains. The problem with a poled-out jib is that it's not possible to tack in an instant, the pole is long, and when attached to the mast it reaches all the way to the headstay (with the babystay inbetween). To tack, we have to move the pole on the other side of the baby stay (not a quick thing to do). By then, the wind had come up and running under main alone was plenty.</p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/pl_17.jpg' loading='lazy'>

<p>It's when we turned into Princess Royal Reach that things became more exciting. The wind rose, whistling through the rigging and pushing us fast toward our destination. We ran under full main, the wind pushing us at 8-9 knots. We thought to anchor in Deserted Bay, but we could see now that in strong inflow wind, it would not offer shelter. When we entered the first reach, our plan  was to stay there, and to enter Princess Louisa the next morning at slack tide. Deserted Bay would remain deserted that day, we pushed on.</p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/pl_18.jpg' loading='lazy'>

<p>To enter Princess Louisa Inlet, it is necessary to enter through Malibu Rapids at or near slack tide. We knew that slack that evening was at 21h40. When we gave up on Deserted Bay it was 18h30, we were closing in on Queen's Reach and decided to douse the main to slow our progress (we had many hours to wait until slack).</p>

<p>The wind just kept howling and howling at our heels, so instead of waiting in this terrible place we moved into a little quiet nook called Patrick Pt just when turning into Queen's Reach.</p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/pl_15.jpg' loading='lazy'>

<p>This place was in a wind shadow, not a ripple in the water. We let the boat drift here for a while, and then opened a tiny jib and let ourselves drift at a slow speed of 1-1.5 knots toward the entrance to Princess Louisa Inlet.</p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/pl_16.jpg' title='malibu rapids entrance ahead' loading='lazy'>

<p>We knew that entering at 21h40 meant that it would be a bit dark, but thank goodness for long summer days! We wandered near the entrance, and looked with a pair of binoculars to see if the water appeared disturbed. We saw no disturbance, and decided to process on through. It is always a good idea to look first to make sure that the water is at slack, sometimes water likes to cheat time. Other boaters, we've heard, have shown up at slack to find the waters running fast still.</p>

<p>For Malibu Rapids, it is important to refer to the CHS tide tables vol. 5, and to refer to the time of high water or low water at Point Atkinson. Slack tide at Malibu Rapids is 25 minutes after high water, or 35 minutes after low water. The water is navigable 15 minutes before or after this time. Boats with larger engines will tell you that it is possible to power through an opposing current, but we don't understand that mentality at all. "It's fine if you go 10 knots!" Yea, or you could just... wait for slack? We recommend entering at high water, instead of low. Note that a lot of navigation software (OpenCPN, WXTides, JTides etc) use public domain harmonic.idx sources files that do not display the right currents for these rapids.</p>

<p>The water was flat calm on our entrance, we had no issues at all. The entrance has a sort of S shape, making it hard to see the entrance if coming from the south, but it is easy to see because of the Christian Youth Camp perched right on the north shore.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it was getting very dark by then, and we could not see the entrance to Princess Louisa Inlet in all of its glory. We could see the cliffs rising high, all around us, but clouds masked the tops, giving the impression that they reached even higher.</p>

<p>It is another 4 nautical miles to the dock in Princess Louisa Inlet. We saw that there were some free moorings on MacDonald Island, but Devine was deadset on going for the dock. I (Rek) feared that the dock would be full, and that we'd have to return to the moorings area in an ever darker dark. We arrived at the dock to find that there were indeed, plenty of boats on it, but there was room. Thankfully, most boats, whether sail or motor, have a white hull and are easy to see, even in the dark dark.</p>

<p>We moored on the dock at 22h30, exhausted, but glad to have arrived, and thankful to not be stuck outside of the inlet all night. We had ramen, a NA beer, and went straight to bed .</p>

<h2>Chatterbox Falls Dock</h2>

<p>About McDonald --</p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/pl_11.jpg' loading='lazy'>

<p>We awoke to a wondrous sight the next morning. Chatterbox Falls are right by the dock, and the sound echoes throughout the inlet.</p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/pl_12.jpg' loading='lazy'>

<p>PLI is truly a picturesque place, nestled between extraordinarily large mountains, blessed with clear waters, and lush forests. A short trail leads to the falls, wearing a jacket is recommended.</p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/pl_09.jpg' loading='lazy'>

<p>The dock is large and has room to moor on both sides, although the end of the ramp is reserved for small tour boats (area is marked by yellow paint), and the other end is there to accomodate float planes. Visitors by boat only come for a short time, long enough to have lunch and to take pictures of the Falls.</p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/pl_06.jpg' loading='lazy'>

<p>There is no way to come to this inlet other than by small float plane, or by boat (there is no road). The waters around the dock are deep, we had 90 feet under our keel (50°12.281'N, 123°46.159'W).</p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/pl_07.jpg' loading='lazy'>

<p>The dock in Princess Louisa Inlet is often populated by large motor boats, all of which run their engines at one point in the day(sometimes twice a day, or all day) to charge their batteries. In a quiet place, it seems like there's never really a good time to run an engine and/or generator. At times, we had to shut the windows to keep the noise and smell out.</p>

<p>The dock is a fine place if you're in a chatty mood, and it was nice to stay there for one day, but we soon grew tired of the noise.</p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/pl_05.jpg' loading='lazy'>

<p>Our friend Jerry was moored on the dock when we arrived, we hung out on his boat for a day (they left the next day).</p>

<h2>Moorings</h2>

<p>SE of the dock are 5 park mooring buoys, with 4 more near MacDonald Island further south. It's a good alternative when in need of some privacy, and when tired of breathing exhaust fumes at the dock (50°12.111'N, 123°46.027'W).</p>

<p>The SE moorings are near another set of falls, and offers a nice view on the opening of the inlet further south.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter where you moor in this inlet, the view is always wonderfully dramatic.</p>

<h2>Trapper's Cabin Trail</h2>

<img src='../media/content/travel/pl_01.jpg' loading='lazy'>

<p>A trail leads to the remains of a trapper's cabin, accessible by the Chatterbox Falls dock.</p>

<p>We packed water, jackets, snacks, a med-kit, flashlights and a radio, just to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>Signs warn of the dangers of this trail, that it is unmaintained and hazardous. Indeed, this trail is an uphill battle, where one must contend with loose soil, patches of wet moss, and many protruding roots.</p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/pl_03.jpg' loading='lazy'>

<p>Going up is more tiring than it is difficult, pink and orange tape in the trees mark the trail, but most times it is easy enough to see the right way up. If the climb is especially difficult, you can be sure that you've gone off trail. The ground is well-trodden, making it that much easier to see where to go.</p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/pl_04.jpg' loading='lazy'>

<p>As expected, the forest here is absolutely stunning, with lots of fallen giants, intertwining root systems, and mounds of thick, wet moss.</p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/pl_02.jpg' loading='lazy'>

<p>We didn't make it to the trapper's cabin, an 1h30 into this climb and my(Rek) knees were ready to give out, and we wanted to keep some energy for the way down. Going down was slow, and tricky, it is easy to see how people can get hurt here. I fell 3 times on my butt (nothing serious, just a few bum bruises), the terrain is very unstable and slippery. We proceeded slowly, and arrived back down safely.</p>
