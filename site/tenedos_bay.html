<h1>tenedos bay</h1><p><b>Tenedos Bay<br>22.08.09</b></p>

<img src='../media/content/travel/tenedos_06.jpg' alt='tenedos bay from the cliff lookout, with pino anchored in the bay below' loading='lazy'>

<p>After our long-stay in <a href='hathayim_marine_park.html' class='local'>hathayim marine park</a>, we returned to <a href='melanie_cove.html' class='local'>melanie cove</a> for 11 days, only to discover what that cove was like during the apparently busiest week of the summer. Prideaux was filled with super yachts. We did our best now to barf as we moved past. Over in Melanie Cove, swinging freely was not an option. We stern-tied to a tree, with neighbors at our immediate left and right. I've never seen a bay so packed with boats. There was a concert happening on the weekend (we didn't know), next year, we'll be sure to arrive later. After that weekend the big boats cleared out, and the cove returned to a semi-quiet state.</p>

<p>The bay that was previously filled with jellyfish appeared devoid of any on this particular visit, that is, until you dive a few feet underwater. The moon jellyfish are there, but they stay about 6 feet below, away from the warmer current. They hover in the depths, waiting for the cold to return so they can bob back to the surface. Rekka enjoyed diving near, to the edge of the jellyfish layer. The water is clear to about 10 feet ahead, and below. It is sometimes scary to swim in water where you can't see the bottom, but the thick floor of jellyfish provided some comfort, as odd as it sounds.</p>

<p>We left on August 8th, went to Refuge Cove to re-supply on fresh veggies. We got some expensive (but delicious) corn, and sailed over to Tenedos Bay, a short ride away.</p>

<p>We left early in the morning, around 6am. This is the best time to be on the water. Desolation Sound is plagued with motor boat traffic, but there are fewer out there in the early mornings. They are big, fast, loud, smelly, and leave ridiculous wakes as they pass. Our ride was pleasant, especially since the sun had not yet had time to get too warm. The days are hot, hovering around 28-30C.</p>

<p>The entrance marker for Tenedos is a huge bluff, it is tall and absolutely breathtaking. Some rocks lie in the entrance, if coming from north of Mink Island, but the tide was low enough that we could see most of them.</p>

<p>Tenedos is a huge bay, with many different spots to anchor and lots of little nooks to tuck into. Because we enjoy sheltered locations, we aimed for a spot at the northwestern end of the bay. The bight is long and narrow, and because it is narrow stern-tying is necessary. We dropped the hook almost across the waterway, and backed to tie onto a tree. The tide wasn't too low then, and it wasn't too hard for Devine to clamber up the cliff to tie up. The next morning we saw how low the water can get, and how impossible it would be to tie at this spot in low water. The wall gets tall, and sharp, crusty sea things come into view, ready to cut holes in your feets and shoes.</p>

<p>The sea floor is rock, we're not used to anchoring in rock... and hope that our anchor handles it well (so far so good). Tenedos Bay is a deep water anchorage (300-600 feet in its centre) over all, but some areas are shallower. We anchored in 37 feet (at high tide), but the water drops to 25 feet at low tide. When the water is low, a spit of land dries up, cutting our little nook from 3 fathom cove to the south. When the water is high, people transit through by dinghy, kayak or paddleboard.</p>

<p>The cliff side is full of arbutus trees, mosses and dry grasses.</p>

<p>There is a trail near the 'land bridge' that leads to the top of a large cliff which overlooks the entire bay. We could see the top from our spot in the water, because the view point is marked by a Canadian flag.</p>

<p>Devine climbed up one afternoon, and snapped a few shots. It is a steep, arduous climb, but well worth the effort.</p>

<p>Someone left a notebook and pen in a bottle atop the viewpoint for people to sign, and so we left our mark.</p>

<p>The water in this bay is wonderfully warm, and clear, clearer than anywhere else we've been so far. There are tons of seals and pups, as well as large shoals of fish. They are impressive. Sitting on the rock shelf at high tide while in the water, we saw this shoal swim by.</p>

<p>More soon...</p>
